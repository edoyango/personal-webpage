         <h1>Dec 2021 Adelaide, Australia</h1>
         <p>My partner, Winn, and her family typically take an annual trip to Guang Zhou, China during the summer break as a family. Unfortunately, China still had borders locked to prevent COVID from entering the country. Instead, Winn planned a road trip for the family to Adelaide, departing from their place in Melbourne, with a stopever in Grampians on the way back. On the trip would be Winn, her parents, her youngest brother (Stone), and myself. We would all fit inside a Nissan Elgrand (like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nissan+elgrand+2008&amp;client=firefox-b-e&amp;sxsrf=ALiCzsYLqaKS_20M9l6wP2VthwBnMN6TVQ:1672741391668&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiW9c2jl6v8AhWlyzgGHcD2DagQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=714&amp;dpr=2#imgrc=RCJPNFYqKMp09M">these</a> but grey/silver) which can fit 7. We planned on staying overnight at places along the way to Adelaide, and two nights in Adelaide itself.</p>
<h3 id="warrnambool">Warrnambool</h3>
<p>Our first stopover was in Warrnambool, about 6.5h from Maribyrnong, the suburb we were starting from. As Stone was on his learners driving license, we got him to drive the scenic route along great ocean road to practice his driving along windy roads and for long distances. We&rsquo;ve all made many a trip along the great ocean road, so we didnt&rsquo; stop for sightseeing many times but we did make a visit to Loch Ard Gorge, which Winn&rsquo;s family hadn&rsquo;t seen before. After arriving at our accomodation in Warnambool (Motel Warrnambool), we visited Tower Hill Wildlife Reserve. The reserve, besides having Australian animals like emus, koalas, and kangaroos, is also located on an extinct volcano. For dinner in Warrnambool, we wandered around Liebig St, which had a strip of restaurants and stores. We eventually settled on Two Kings Burgers, which had very tasty and big burgers.</p>

<h3 id="naracoorte-via-mt-gambier">Naracoorte via Mt Gambier</h3>
<p>Today we would be crossing the Victoria-South Australia border. Super exciting, giving how we&rsquo;ve been stuck in Victoria for two years! Our goal destination today was Naracoorte, but we made a stopover first at Port Fairy, about 30 minutes&rsquo; drive from Warrnambool. There we enjoyed a nice stroll around Griffiths Island, with scenic beaches and heaps of wallabies.</p>
<p>Our next stop was Mt Gambier, where we had lunch and visited the Umpherston Sinkhole (AKA Balumbul), and the Blue Lake. There&rsquo;s not a lot to do in Mt Gambier, but it worked really well as a break stop.</p>
<p>Before arriving at The Avenue Inn, our accomodatin in Naracoorte, we made one more stop at Naracoorte Caves, where we had a tour of the underground caves (requires booking in advance).</p>

<h3 id="adelaide">Adelaide</h3>
<p>From Naracoorte, we did the hard yards and made 4h drive to Adelaide, stopping only for fuel about a third of the way in. In Adelaide, we stayed at a CBD apartment with a nice view of the mountains</p>
<p>Before getting to Adelaide, we visited Hahndorf, a town built like a German town with themed restaurants and stores. We only made a short visit - walking up and down the streets to enjoy the novelty and the closest we&rsquo;ve been to going to Europe since the COVID lockdowns ðŸ¤£.</p>
<p>Our first stop in Adelaide were Heron Way Reserve and Hallett Cove, pretty well known for their boardwalks. The views are beuatiful, but the beaches aren&rsquo;t too great, as they&rsquo;re very rocky. We then hung out at Glenelg Beach for a bit, which was much more suitable for lounging about and swimming.</p>
<p>On day two of Adelaide, we got to learn about the history of South Australia&rsquo;s most well-known product: Wine! We visited the National Wine Centre of Australia, located in the CBD, which had exhibits explaining the proliferation of Wine in Australia, as well as tastings of local and international wine varieties. We then made a visit to the Central Market, which is probably the best fresh produce market I&rsquo;ve ever been to. For dinner that night, we bought mushroom and duck patte, turkish bread, steaks, cheeses, olives, and some cheap wine. The musroom patte was incredibly tasty! We had paella for lunch at the market, which was pretty good. We used the afternoon the enjoy the weather at Henley beach, which was awesome, bar the crabs who would nip you if you stepped to close ðŸ¦€.</p>
<p>Before leaving, our final visit was to the South Australia Museum, and another visit to the Central market.</p>

<h3 id="grampians">Grampians</h3>
<p>From Adelaide, we drove directly to Arrarat, the town just outside of the Grampian where we would be staying. Our only stops were to fill up petrol, at Borderlands White Kangaroo Park, and pink lake in Dimboola. The kangaroo park was pretty cool because of the surprising number of albino kangaroos hanging around. The pink lake was less like a lake, and more of a salt flat - probably because it was summer and the water had dried up.</p>
<p>We visited the Grampians the day after arriving at Arrarat. Winn&rsquo;s family hadn&rsquo;t been to the Grampians before, so we hit the main spots:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/mount-william">Mount William</a>,</li>
<li>Mackenzie Falls (Stone and I took a dip to refresh after the hike),</li>
<li>Lake Bellfield, and</li>
<li>Boroka Lookout.</li>
</ul>
<p>And after a 2h drive back to Melbourne, our trip was brought to a close on year year&rsquo;s eve - ready to tackle the new year!</p>
