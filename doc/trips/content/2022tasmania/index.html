         <h1>Dec 2022 Tasmania, Australia</h1>
         <p>In lieue of going to China, who have yet to sort out their COVID situation, Winn and myself organised another road trip like the previous year&rsquo;s, but this time to Tasmania!</p>
<p>This trip&rsquo;s participants would be Myself, Winn, her brothers Stone and Tim, Tim&rsquo;s girlfriend Yvette, and Winn&rsquo;s parents. We would all fit inside a Nissan Elgrand (like these but grey/silver) which can fit 7. The plan would be that I, alone, would drive the Elgrand from Maribyrnong where her family is located, to Geelong. At Geelong, I hopped onto the Spirit of Tasmania and rode the boat to Tasmania with the car. After arriving, I would pick up Winn, who would be arriving by plane a couple hours after the Spirit of Tasmania would dock. We would spend a couple days together without the family, who would also be arriving by plane. We would spend a week altogether packed in the Elgrand travelling around Tasmania. After a week, everyone goes back to Melbourne, and I would be doing the Overland Track by myself before returning to Melbourne.</p>
<h3 id="greens-beach-and-tamar-valley-wineries">Greens Beach and Tamar Valley Wineries</h3>
<p>Prior to the family arriving, Winn and I stayed in Greens Beach - near the mouth of Tamar River. We stayed at <a href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/44380240">The Zen Shack</a>, which had a beautiful view of the ocean and river which we could wake up and fall asleep to every night.</p>
<p>For the two days there, we took it pretty easy, as a way to wind down from work and to enjoy all the breweries and wineries along the Tamar River. We visited (in order):</p>
<ol>
<li>Moores Hill Estate,</li>
<li>Tamar Ridge Cellar Door and Turner Stillhouse, and</li>
<li>Brady&rsquo;s Lookout Cider.</li>
</ol>
<p>Prior to the Overland track, I also needed to break in my new hiking shoes (Merrell Moab Speed GTX) that I bought specifically for the Overland track, so we also did the <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/tasmania/greens-beach-headland">Greens Beach Headland track</a> (just the head part), and on <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/tasmania/mount-arthur-walking-track">Mount Arthur</a>.</p>
<p>We also made a visit to Grindelwald, which is a weird little Swiss town replica near Launceston. It was honestly pretty bizarre, and would only recommend visiting if you&rsquo;re interested in wondering what happens when the founder of Woolworths tries to recreate the beauty of the Swiss village of Grindelwald. Interesting fact: to build a house in the area, you must sign a contract that ensures that the house has specific features that give it the &ldquo;Swiss&rdquo; aesthetic!</p>

<h3 id="launceston-to-cradle-mountain">Launceston to Cradle Mountain</h3>
<p>Once the rest of the family arrived in Launceston, we made a visit to Cataract Gorge, which we were suprised to learn had peacocks roaming the space and trying to woo peahens! We then went to Cradle Mountain, passing Ashgrove Cheese Dairy Door on the way. The dairy door is a pretty fun place to stop. My personal favourite part is the 1kg cheese offcuts you can buy that are much cheaper than if you were to buy in store, albeit in a less workable shape.</p>
<p>At Cradle Mountian, we were staying in Cradle Mountain Highlander Cottages - super convenient as it&rsquo;s a few minutes walk from the visitor centre, where the shuttles to cradle mountain national park depart from. The cottages were pretty cozy - a bit tight for 7 people, but made it a pretty fun experience.</p>
<p>There are a couple restaurants near the visitor centre, but they&rsquo;re a bit pricy. Budget travellers should remember to buy food before heading up!</p>
<p>We spent two nights in the national park, and with the single whole day we had there, myself, Tim, Yvette, and Stone successfully summitted Mt Cradle. We were a little intimidated by the description given by the visitor centre receptionist, who highlighted the challenge of the rock scrambling near Mt Cradle Summit. But Stone&rsquo;s confidence motivated us all and proved to us that Mt Cradle is &ldquo;light work&rdquo; (in Stone&rsquo;s words). Winn and the parents accompanied us until Marion&rsquo;s lookout and then returned on their own as the rest of us continued to Mt Cradle.</p>
<p>Most impressive was Yvette, who hadn&rsquo;t brought hiking shoes and summitted Mt Cradle with Vans. Stone also demonstrated a strong effort with this being his first ever hike.</p>
<p>Starting from the Dove Lake bus dropoff, going to Mt Cradle via Wombat Pool, and returning via the boatshed, took us about 8h. The Cradle Mountain Summit climb itself took us 1.5h to get to the summit.</p>

<h3 id="cradle-mountain-to-bicheno">Cradle Mountain to Bicheno</h3>
<p>From the mountains to the beach! Satisfied with our achievement of summitting Cradle Mountain, we started the long Journey to Bicheno (3.5h driving). We made a stopover at Christmas Hill&rsquo;s Raspberry Farm, which is near Ashgrove Cheese Dairy Door. The front-end of the farm is a cafe where you can order raspberry accented dishes. We all got different dishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>eggs benedict (nothing special),</li>
<li>waffles with raspberry ice cream (probably our favourite), and</li>
<li>scones with raspberry jam (pretty good).</li>
</ul>
<p>We finished the stopover by buying 2kg of their &ldquo;jam&rdquo; (i.e. ugly) black berries and strawberries. We also got a small box of their premium raspberries (we avoided the jam raspberries because much of the bottom half had been crushed under the other half). My favourite was the blackberries. We also loved having a quick peek at the Alapacas munching on Grass near the cafe!</p>
<p>We eventually arrived at our <a href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/40317681">AirBnB in Bicheno</a>, which we would spend another two nights at. There are a couple places to eat in the area, but we didn&rsquo;t explore them as our resident amateur chefs Tim and Stone generously prepared feasts both nights we were there (with help from Winn and Yvette). Bicheno has the Blowhole, which is a rock formation that shoots water up a hole when waves crash on the rocky shore. Nearby the hole are crabs and plenty of rockpools teeming with sealife.</p>
<p>The first half of the full day at Bicheno was learning, the hard way, the struggles of living in regional areas with limited medical coverage. Tim injured himself at the blowhole around 6:30am and since the nearby medical clinic wouldn&rsquo;t open until 9am, we drove up to St Helens so he could be attended to at the 24h emergency department. Because of that, we couldn&rsquo;t really start our day until 12pm.</p>
<p>The remainder of the day we used to make a visit the Freycinet Marine Farm for our first taste of fresh Tasmanian Oyster&rsquo;s (which was the only thing Winn&rsquo;s mum was looking forward to). We then made our way down to Freycinet National Park where there are many hikes varying in length (from day hikes to multi-day hikes). Our energy levels restricted us to the Wineglass Bay Lookout track (about 1h return). We finished off the trip with with a late lunch at Devil&rsquo;s Corner Winery accompanied with wine tastings. We closed the day at home with a feast at the AirBnB!</p>

<h3 id="bicheno-to-mt-rumney-hobart">Bicheno to Mt Rumney (Hobart)</h3>
<p>Our drive to Hobart was accented with stopovers at 9 mile beach (a beautiful and quiet beach with clear and shallow, but freezing waters), Kate&rsquo;s Berry Farm (try the sour candies!), and Pooley Wines (Italian-style wines with a cool italian aesthetic, but probably my least favourite winery on this trip).</p>
<p>Our first visit in Hobart was Ramen at Bar Wa Izakaya for lunch, which they only serve between 12-3pm. Then we made our way to <a href="https://mtrumneyescapes.com.au/">our accomodation</a>, which we booked via AirBnB. The cool thing about the place was that it was mostly self-sustained via solar panels, batteries, and rain water. As far as I was aware, only the gas canisters which powered the stove needed swapping out. To add, the views from the place were amazing, and plenty of indifferent wallabies hanging around.</p>
<p>The next morning, we visited Salamanca Markets, which I used as an opportunity to buy some supplies for my upcoming Overland Track trek. The market has heaps of stalls selling food, so I tasted a curry scallop pie, which you had to be a scallop lover to appreciate; tried some oysters, which weren&rsquo;t as good as the ones we tried in Freycinet; and grabbed some &ldquo;Bourbon&rdquo; beef jerky for snacks on the hike. I got the book &ldquo;The Long Hitch Home&rdquo; By Jamie Maslin, who had a stall where he was selling and signing copies of his book. Tim and Yvette got two books by Luke Richmond who had another stall selling and signing his books!</p>
<p>The market was followed by a visit to the (in)famous MONA. My favourite exhibit being the Tomás Saraceno&rsquo;s exhibits with spider webs - especially the spider web scanning piece.</p>
<p>We closed with an early dinner at Bar Wa Izakaya again, to take advantage of the happy-hour half-price oysters. Winn and I aren&rsquo;t fans of oysters, but the rest of the family demolished plate after plate of oysters coupled with sake and beers.</p>
<p>The day after was Christmaaaas 🎄 which was our rest day since most things were closed anyway. We had a big Christmas steak dinner with a couple tomahawk and sirloin steaks cooked by the expert steak chef, Stone Ma.</p>
<p>Boxing day is when the family would depart, but their flight wouldn&rsquo;t be until the evening. So, we spent the morning visiting Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary and feeding spoilt kangaroos; and at Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens exploring the themed gardens and enjoying the company of ducklings with apparently no sense of danger.</p>

<h3 id="bream-creek">Bream Creek</h3>
<p>After dropping off the family, I had two nights with Winn to pack for the Overland Track. We did so in the comfort of a <a href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/46418176">farm stay cabin in Bream Creak</a> overlooking the ocean.</p>
<p>Besides sorting dehydrated foods into zip-lock bags, Winn and I made a visit to the beach at Marion Bay which had beautiful fine-sanded beaches, littered with shells and unfortunately, blue-bottle jellyfish corpses. We still enjoyed a relaxing beach lay down by the mouth of Bream Creek (the actual creek, not the suburb).</p>
<p>The fun part about the stay at the farm stay was the random encounters with cows as they&rsquo;re herded by the farmers between paddocks!</p>
<p><img src="/trips/img/trips-tasmania2022/bream-creek/DSC_1200.jpeg" alt="DSC_1200.jpeg"  class="fullwidth" /></p>
<h3 id="the-overland-track">The Overland Track</h3>
<p>See <a href="/trips/content/otdetails.html">here</a> if you&rsquo;re interested extra details of the trek, including packing information, transport logistics, and overall cost. I&rsquo;ve also added some tips that I learnt on the trip e.g. from other hikers.</p>
<p>The Overland Track is Tasmania&rsquo;s premier 6-day trek starting from Ronny Creek near Cradle Mountain, and ending at Lake St Clair visitor centre. Each night you can stay at a hut by sleeping in the bunks within, or by camping on the platforms adjacent. Besides shelter and camping platforms, the huts have the only toilets on the track and provide rain water to use for cooking and drinking. Also remember that there isn&rsquo;t reception for most of the track! You might get reception on the summits, but I didn&rsquo;t get any after Barn Bluff. So, bring something to do during leisure time.</p>
<p>The most exciting part of the hike is not actually the hike connecting huts, but the out-and-back side trips which take you to the mountain summits and lakes or waterfalls near to the track. Each one of these hikes are totally optional and thankfully don&rsquo;t need to be done with your pack. Parks Tasmania, who you get the hiking permit from doesn&rsquo;t mandate a finish time (unlike NZ&rsquo;s <a href="/trips/content/2019nz/#milford-track">Milford Track</a>, so you can play around with the hike schedule and stay at huts multiple nights (e.g., to take a break or to do more side trips) or merge days to shorten the length of the trip.</p>
<p>This trek was the longest unsupported hike (i.e. bringing my own food and tent) I have ever done. While the <a href="/trips/content/2017italy/#post-study-travel-tour-du-mont-blanc">Tour du Mont Blanc</a> 10-day hike I did many years ago was longer, I didn&rsquo;t have to bring food or a tent as both would be provided at refuges along the way. There is also always the comfort that you can bail at almost any time, whereas with the Overland Track, you either finish it, go back to the start, or you&rsquo;re helicoptered out.</p>
<p>Another challenge I had to overcome on the hike was my sleep apnoea. This meant I needed to bring a CPAP machine, powered by a battery which I needed to keep charged via solar panels. Cradle Mountain is known for it&rsquo;s erratic weather, being hot one day and snowing the next (even in summer!). I was a little unsure if I could maintain enough charge to sleep properly, and without a functioning CPAP machine, I would wake up tired and groggy, and probably keep up other hikers with my chainsaw-like snoring too!</p>
<h4 id="day-1-ronny-creek-to-waterfall-valley-hut">Day 1: Ronny Creek to Waterfall Valley hut</h4>
<p>I got up early at 5am to make sure I had everything sorted. I stayed at Launceston Backpackers, where I could leave the car. I was picked up by Overland Track Transport around 6:20am at my accomodation, and picked up the other hikers: Tristan and Maddy from brisbane, Mingrui also from Melbourne, and Connor from Sydney. It was so easy to strike up a conversation - we were all so pumped!</p>
<p>We stopped at a bakery cafe about an hour after, where I got a coffee and Venison Pie.</p>
<p>just before 9am, we were dropped off at the Cradle Mountain visitor centre where we were to check-in, listen to a safety briefing, and take the shuttle bus to Ronny Creek - the start of the Overland Track. At the safety briefing, I met Edmund, from Sydney. I gad forgotten matches, which I would definitely need for my gas stove and to cook my food! Thankfully, the visitor centre has a store with hiking gear. I assume they had to open it because of hikers like me forgetting things haha!</p>
<p>I arrived at Ronny Creek just before 10am and took off a couple layers, put on sunscreen, and filled out the log book (which we should be doing at the start and end of the hike, and at every hut). This all took maybe 15mins. And then the excitement began! I got some photos next to the Overland Track sign to start with, and off I went! Of course, the steepest part of the entire hike (not including side-trips), is at the beginning - when the pack is fullest! We ascended about 330m over 3km to Marion&rsquo;s Lookout (~11% average gradient) via Crater Lake. At the start of the climb, my heart rate spiked to almost 180bpm having not done any practice hikes with my full pack.</p>
<p>I reached Marion&rsquo;s lookout at around 11:20 - 1h 20mins after arriving at Ronny Creek. I asked a day-tripper to help take photos of me beecause I hadn&rsquo;t the last time I was here. I didn&rsquo;t break for long, and continued to Kitchen hut i.e., the start of the Cradle Mountain summit side trip hike, which took about 40mins.</p>
<p>I summitted cradle mountain with the family the week before, but wanted to do it again to see how quickly I could do it without having to wait for others. This time, instead of about 90mins, I did it in 50mins! Probably helped that I had done it before too. I ate my daily bag of trailmix at the top and descended back down to where I left my pack, to discover a Currawong had broken into my bag and stolen my beef jerky and apricot snacks - both supposed to be treats on the hike 😢.</p>
<p>Continuing on, the track took me to behind Cradle Mountain where the terrain undulated slightly and became more rocky. At this point, the excitement of starting had started to wear off, and began to feel more tired and frustrated at the rocky terrain. Just after walking around the base of Cradle Mountain, the Overland Track follows Cradle Cirque, and the path turns to boardwork - much easier to walk on! But alas, the relief was only temporary, as the path turns to gravel and rocks again as I descend down into Waterfall Valley.</p>
<p>I arrive at the hut around 4:20pm feeling pretty tired. The Waterfall Valley Hut is actually super nice, and from the outside, looks like a cabin you would find on AirBnB for hundreds a night. But of course, there&rsquo;s no utilities besides rainwater tanks to fill up from, and a gas heater for the shared dining room. There was ample spaces in the hut, but I chose to stay in the tent - simply because there&rsquo;s more privacy in my tent than in the bunks.</p>
<p>The remainder of my evening was spent chatting to the hikers from my bus in the dining room, marvelling at the wombat grazing next to the hut, and reading until falling asleep at 9pm.</p>

<h4 id="day-2-waterfall-valley-to-windermere">Day 2: Waterfall Valley to Windermere</h4>
<p>Today was going to be a big day. The plan was to backtrack a little bit by ascending back up to Cradle Cirque, and to summit Barn Bluff. This one I&rsquo;ve wanted to do since the first summit of Cradle Mountain, and seeing Barn Bluff in the distance. After Barn Bluff, I would return back to the Waterfall Valley Hut and continue along the main track to the hut at Windermere.</p>
<p>I got up bright and early at 5:30am - the birdsong is beautiful to wake up to, although I wish they started a bit later 😅. I smashed some coffee and oats for breakfast, and departed for Barn Bluff at about 6:50am. I left my tent setup on the platform and only brought a pack of trail mix and fleece jumper with me. Apparently clouds were coming in, so the view at the Barn Bluff summit could be obstructed if I get up there too late. The ascend back up to Cradle Circue was a good warm up, and from there, it was a comfortable stroll to the rock scramble that would be Barn Bluff.</p>
<p>The climb up Barn Bluff, like Cradle Mountain, had large dolerite boulders that one has to scramble around to reach the top. Unlike Cradle Mountain however, the scramble route is shorter as the route to the summit is more direct. But adding to the difficulty is the looser rocks and the less visible markings for the route.</p>
<p>I summitted Barn Bluff at roughly 8:40am and arrived just before the clouds arrived. It was very windy and I wish I had brought the rain jacket! But the views were well worth the effort. I snapped some pics and went back to Waterfall Valley Hut and arrived at 10:40am.</p>
<p>I later learnt a couple in my wave of hikers got engaged at the summit of Barn&rsquo;s Bluff 😊</p>
<p>I packed my belongings from the tent platform and left Waterfall Valley hut at around 11:40am. Only a handful of hikers had gone backward to see Barn Bluff like I did, so Waterfall Valley hut was pretty empty by the time I left.</p>
<p>The walk to Windermere Hut undulated a fair bit. Going up to Barn Bluff, I didn&rsquo;t have a pack, and boy did I not miss it. My shoulders and upper back got tired pretty quickly and up hills were certainly much harder. A lot of the day was over buttongrass plains with mountain peaks in the background. Clouds had come in as predicted, but only a few droplets came down while I was on the track.</p>
<p>I dipped my feet in the chilly waters of the lake just before Windermere hut. I skipped the side trip to lake Will, so the lake nearby Windermere was my first contact with a body of water (apparently Lake Will is prettier because of the sandy beach and Barn Bluff in the background).</p>
<p>After a break at the lake, I arrive at Windermere hut at around 2:45pm. Tonight I would be staying in the bunks because of the potential for rain overnight. Again, there was ample space, helped by how many hikers skipped this hut and went to the next one. All the hikers on my bus to Cradle Mountain skipped this hut as they were on a tighter schedule. I shared my bunk dorm with Maddy and James, who were form Melbourne and super friendly and approachable.At dinner, I also chatted to Emily and her partner who had just complete the Tour du Mont Blanc a couple months before and were excited to meet someone else who had done it.</p>
<p>I was in bed pretty early today at around 7:20pm and read before falling asleep around 9pm.</p>

<h4 id="day-3-windermere-to-pelion">Day 3: Windermere to Pelion</h4>
<p>The decision to sleep in the huts was the right one - it rained throughout the night albeit lightly. But that didn&rsquo;t stop me from sleeping terribly from trying to avoid moving because of my noisy sleeping mat.</p>
<p>I woke up a bit later this time and didn&rsquo;t depart the hut until 8am. Today was the biggest day with the pack - 16.8km, but with no side trips. The route undulates for most of the way, with an ascent of just under 200m after the 13th kilometer.</p>
<p>Thanks to the cloudy weather, I didn&rsquo;t see much until about halfway when the clouds cleared when I had passed the good views (e.g., Forth Valley Lookout) and was making my way through the jungle forest 😑. The rain from the night before wetted the tracks and made some parts slippery and muddy. I slipped a couple times thanks to wet rocks 😠.</p>
<p>On the track, I stopped for snacks and lunch at Pelion Creek and Forth River. I arrived at the hut at 1:15pm - 5.25h after I left Windermere hut.</p>
<p>I arrived with nobody at the hut except the ranger. A couple tents were setup and sleeping bags in the bunks, so I guess people had arrived and were on other adventures. If one were to take a break for a day, apparently Pelion Hut is the spot to do it - Mt Oakleigh is a side-trip hike nearby and there is fossil beach to have a look at. Pelion Hut also has a beautiful view of Mt Oakleigh to sit and enjoy, which myself and many of my co-hikers did.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I had free, I napped, made a visit to Old Pelion Hut where I made use of the nearby stream to wash myself and my socks, and to relax and read in my tent or with Mt Oakleigh in view. The partly skies meant I could charge my battery enough to use my CPAP for one more night.</p>
<p>I fiddled around with the fit of my straps and how I carried my pack, which got rid of a lot of the soreness I was feeling in my shoulders and back I was feeling the previous days.</p>

<h4 id="day-4-pelion-to-kia-ora">Day 4: Pelion to Kia Ora</h4>
<p>Another challenging day coming up! Today we would climb up to and cross Pelion Gap, a mountain pass that sits on the saddle between Pelion East and Mt Ossa. I planned on doing the Mt Ossa side trip today - like almost everyone I talked to who was walking today, since it&rsquo;s Tasmania&rsquo;s highest point! The whole day was expected to take around 7h as per the guidebook.</p>
<p>I woke up early because my CPAP battery had depleted early. This gave me the chance to talk to Rochelle, another solo hiker from Canada. After packing my tent and cleaning off the leech that attached itself to the underside, I departed from Pelion hut at 7-ish am - a bit after Rochelle. We play an unintentional game of overtaking leap-frog, and Rochelle gets there a bit before 8:30am - a few minutes before me.</p>
<p>Rochelle and I walked up the pass together - which was very kind, as she was clearly much fitter 😆. But despite my embarrassment from my lack of fitness, it was pleasant to have company up Mt Ossa. We reached the summit of Mt Ossa at about 10am, so it took 1.5h to get up - about half an hour faster than anticipated. There is surprisingly a lot of plant life at the top! I gave my best effort to not crush them underfoot.</p>
<p>The actual summit of Mt Ossa wasn&rsquo;t giving us ideal views because of the cloud cover, so we ventured in the other direction to another pseudo-summit (?) which looked clear of the bad weather. We only made it ~75% of the way as the scramble looked sketchy and I chickened out. I liked Mt Ossa a lot because it was fun to hike up with fun company, and the greenery and mini-pond was charming.</p>
<p>We scrambled back to the real summit and Maddy and James (the couple I bunked with at Windermere Hut) arrived shortly after. They sadly informed me that my bag had been broken into again by Currawongs and had flown off with a noodle packet. Maddie and James kindly packed everything back into my backpack that had been thrown about by the birds. We spent a bit of time exploring the summit and taking photos before descending.</p>
<p>Near the end, we passed a different couple, who said the birds had broken into my bag again! And when I got pack to Du Cane Gap (at around 1pm), I discovered that in additionaly to the noodle packet, the birds took a packet of lunch, and trailmix. There goes most of a day&rsquo;s food! 😬 While I was taking stock of my pack, Rochelle went ahead.</p>
<p>Continuing on, I arrived at the Kia Ora hut around 2:30pm. Kia Ora Hut is the newest hut on the track and, in my opinion, most aesthetically pleasing. Views of Cathedral Mountain made it even better!</p>
<p>I chose to tent again, since the weather looked good. After arriving, I setup my tent, washed myself in the very nearby stream and spent the rest of the night hanging out in the hut with other hikers in my wave. I was avoiding reading too much of my book as I didn&rsquo;t have much book left, but still a couple afternoons to fill. The sun in the afternoon was a bit shy, and my CPAP battery got enough charge for another night after being depleted by the night before 🎉.</p>
<p>In terms of how my body was going - my backpack stopped being a problem and my shoulders and back were tired, but not sore. My feet were the most problematic - with blisters on my right heal and both big toes. The sole of my feet were also a bit sore. My max heart rate from the second day onwards was sitting around 150-160bpm, well below the first day whose max was 179bpm. So I think my body was adjusting pretty well. But I have been noticing that on the ascents with my pack, my heart rate wouldn&rsquo;t go nearly as high as the first day, but felt much harder. I chalked that up to being in calorie deficit as my diet was covering only half of my daily expenditure of energy.</p>

<h4 id="day-5-kia-ora-to-windy-ridge-bert-nichols-hut">Day 5: Kia Ora to Windy Ridge (Bert Nichols Hut)</h4>
<p>My CPAP battery died early again at around 5:30am, so that&rsquo;s when I got up. After coffee and oats for breakfast, and packing up my things, I depart Kia Ora hut around 8am. Today was 9.6km plus side trips to three waterfalls. I was expecting the whole day to be about 5h, so I took it slow getting ready for the day. Today would also have another gap to pass - Du Cane Gap, which would be a bit easier than the day before. Still wasn&rsquo;t looking forward to it though.</p>
<p>Most of the day was in jungle, which I didn&rsquo;t enjoy that much. I reached the first side trip at 9:15, which takes you to see both Fergusson Falls and D&rsquo;Alton Falls. These could only be viewed and not swam in, so I spent some time taking some low shutter-speed photos to try and get the cool streamline effect in waterfalls. Another hour later, I arrived at the bottom of Hartnett Falls - the second side trip. When doing Hartnett Falls, you get to the top first, and then make your way down (takes about 5-10mins).</p>
<p>I had arrived roughly the same time as 10 other hikers from my wave, and they had no issue jumping into the water at the base of the waterfall. I was a chicken however, and I only dipped my feet in so i didn&rsquo;t have to walk around in wet undies. Plus, it was cold!</p>
<p>I spent awhile enjoying my foot bath and trail mix before heading off again at 11am. From Hartnett Falls, is the climb up to Du Cane Gap, which I did with Edmund. This ascent felt the hardest of all the pack climbs I&rsquo;d done so far, but my heart rate was probably at the lowest out of all the pack climbs! Surely I&rsquo;m either in ketosis, or super fatigued.</p>
<p>I arrived at Du Cane Gap at 12:05pm and chilled there and ate lunch (rewarded with no view haha). Edmund, before heading down first, was kind enough to give me one of his energy bars after he learnt about the feast the birds had with my food. I eventually reach Bert Nichols Hut at 12:50pm. Edmund and Rochelle were skipping this hut and going to Pine Valley Hut - a hut not part of the Overland Track and open to anyone. It&rsquo;s typically used as a base to see The Labyrinth and/or The Acropolis. Rochelle and Edmund intended to see the latter, which has better views than even Mt Ossa! I plan to do that next time I&rsquo;m in Tasmania! A big group of 8 hikers skipped this hut also, to go to Narcissus Hut, which is the effective end of the Overland Track.</p>
<p>The early arrival at Ben Nichols meant I could take it easy unpacking and hanging out. I finally got to talk a bit to Genevieve and Anthony from Melbourne, who have been in my wave the whole time, but never found a chance to chat to. I also hung out with Jar (not sure if I spelt that right) and his partner, who are friends with Gen and Anthony. The sun was strong and powered my battery to full, which would guarantee enough power for the rest of the trip.</p>
<p>I slept at 8pm, so I could get up early enough to catch the 9:30am ferry leaving from Narcissus Hut.</p>

<h4 id="day-6-windy-ridge-bert-nichols-hut-to-narcissus-and-ferry-to-lake-st-clair-visitor-centre">Day 6: Windy Ridge (Bert Nichols Hut) to Narcissus and Ferry to Lake St Clair Visitor Centre</h4>
<p>I was woken up at 4:30am by the Gen and Anthony who also wanted to catch the 9:30 ferry. Gen and Anthony had been struggling with their knees the whole hike - especially Gen, who had surgery very recently. None of us booked a spot on that ferry - my booking was for tomorrow morning, and they had planned on walking the extra day from Narcissus Hut to Lake St Clair Visitor Centre. So, hopefully there was enough spots!</p>
<p>I left at 6 after packing up and aimed to power through to Narcissus hut and taking no breaks, to ensure I didn&rsquo;t arrive after the ferry. The day was going to be short (9km, all lightly downhill) and the guide book suggested it would take 3h.</p>
<p>This was the day I saw the most animals! I was the first one on the track, so animals that had been foraging overnight hadn&rsquo;t been scared off yet. I saw a padamelon, a wallaby, and a wombat all on the track! I wasn&rsquo;t quick enough to get a shot of the padamelon though. I also was the one clearing all the spiderwebs for hikers behind me 🎉. I only stopped to snap shots of these animals and the scenery, which there wasn&rsquo;t much of. The day was almost all in the woods, unfortunately. The end of a multi-day hike is often the least interesting for some reason.</p>
<p>I arrived at Narcissus Hut 8:20am, arriving 40mins ahead of schedule. The group of 8 that skipped Bert Nichols hut yesterday were enjoying breakfast, and I also happen to run into Tristan and Maddie again, who I hadn&rsquo;t seen since the first hut! I hung out at the pier, a very short walk away from the hut.</p>
<p>Gen and Anthony arrived at the pier shortly before the 9:30 ferry arrived. We were informed that only two spots were available on the ferry back to the visitor centre, which I gave to Gen and Anthony due to their injuries. Thankfully, the 11:30 ferry had one available spot, and assuming no one had booked it by the time the ferry driver got back to the visitor centre, I could have it.</p>
<p>In case you&rsquo;re wondering, the 11:30 ferry was booked by the guided Overland group, so isn&rsquo;t usually a timeslot available for hikers to choose from.</p>
<p>I bummed around for a couple hours and chatted with the other hikers as they came in. Sometime around 10:30, I used the radio in Narcissus hut to confirm that there was still a spot for me on the 11:30 ferry. And when 11:30 rolled around, off I went to the visitor centre on the ferry! Thus ending my Overland Track journey.</p>
<p>My time at the visitor centre was spent eating food at the lodge (which was ok), getting a spot on the bus back to Launceston, buying souvenirs, chatting with the hikers also waiting for the bus, and letting Winn know I hadn&rsquo;t died (since I had no reception after day 2 on Barn Bluff).</p>

<p>Back in Launceston, I spent the remaining two days getting souvenirs and hanging around the CBD. I stayed at the Pod Inn, which is very affordable (for Launceston), and a great option for Overland Track hikers.</p>
<h4 id="overland-track-reflections">Overland Track Reflections</h4>
<p>By the end of the hike, I didn&rsquo;t feel nearly as tired as I expected. I could&rsquo;ve gone further given enough food and more time in my schedule. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I was in calorie deficit every day, but didn&rsquo;t feel like I didn&rsquo;t bring enough food and early dinners kept me from feeling hungry in the evening.</p>
<p>Doing the track itself was a challenge in a way, but it turned out less of a physical challenge, and more of a preparation challenge. Granted, I intentionally didn&rsquo;t push myself so as to ensure I had a good time, so I didn&rsquo;t do all the side trips (I skipped Mt Oakleigh and Lake Wills) and I didn&rsquo;t merge any days. The uphills with packs were strenuous, but not impossible - there was plenty time in the day for me to slow down and take breaks. I felt like I brought enough food, and after a bit of fiddling with my pack fit, I didn&rsquo;t have any soreness or injuries (my blisters were trivial).</p>
<p>Thanks to the good weather, I didn&rsquo;t struggle very much. Had the weather been more challenging (e.g. snow, or heavy rain), I would&rsquo;ve struggled with the cold as I hadn&rsquo;t brought as much waterproof gear as Parks Tasmania recommends. But besides cold weather gear, I think I would&rsquo;ve liked to have more luxuries e.g., candies and hot chocolate, better coffee, more gatorade, a lightweight chair, and maybe even ultralight gear (if my wallet is willing).</p>
<p>Having to lug around a CPAP, battery, and solar panels was an extra hassle because of the space it took up, the extra weight, and the dependancy on good weather. I can see how sleep apnoea sufferers would be apprehensive with longer overnight hikes.</p>
<p>The views in the hike themselves were very nice, but far from the amazing views you get in New Zealand and the European Alps. To add, the huts on the Overland Track (and in Australia in general), were much more basic than in New Zealand or Europe. New Zealand will have cooking stoves sometimes and sleeping mats, and Europe will have food and mattresses. So in that sense, I would almost always recommend hikers going after views go elsewhere, but Overland Track is certainly for those who appreciate a challenge.</p>
<p>My favourite part of the hike was the comradery and generosity between hikers. After finding out about the birds getting into my pack, everyone who knew offered me food. Other hikers were helped out too - someone&rsquo;s stove didn&rsquo;t work, so Tristan and Maddy gave him their spare. A couple people rolled their ankle, which was met with offers of pain killers and physio tape. And everyone is just so keen to chat!</p>
<p>Overall, I would recommend this hike to anyone who loves the outdoors and animals. You see very unique australian flora and fauna on the track, and the animal encounters are plenty. I would also recommend it to anyone who&rsquo;s an occasional hiker looking for a new challenge. It&rsquo;s much less supported than other permier hikes around the world, and I think that&rsquo;s what makes it appealing and worthy of bragging rights!</p>
