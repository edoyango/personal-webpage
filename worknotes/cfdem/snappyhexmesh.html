			<h1>Snappy Hex Mesh Basics</h1>
            <p>This is a summary of meshing in OpenFOAM using the <code>snappyHexMesh</code> tool. I'm writing this in detail because I couldn't find any comprehensive tutorial that is beginner friendly. The ones I could find were like as if they were picking up from where someone else left off. Consequently, this tool is a beginner guide and aims only to recommend easy-to-pickup tools, rather than the most fully featured tools. This only covers absolute basics and creating simple geometries. It only covers <code>snappyhexMesh</code> tool as the <a href="https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/user-guide/4-mesh-generation-and-conversion/4.4-mesh-generation-with-the-snappyhexmesh-utility">user guide for the basic tool <code>blockMesh</code></a> is pretty ok.</p>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The high-level of how <code>snappyHexMesh</code> works can be found <a href="https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/user-guide/4-mesh-generation-and-conversion/4.4-mesh-generation-with-the-snappyhexmesh-utility">here</a>.</p>

            <p>The basic steps are to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>define the background mesh<br>
                    The background mesh is where the fluid flow will be simulated.
                </li>
                <li>create the <code>stl</code> file<br>
                    This step is to create the object you wish to insert onto the background mesh.
                </li>
                <li>run <code>surfaceFeatureExtract</code><br>
                    This requires the <code>system/surfaceFeatureExtractDict</code> to be created, which defines how edges and surfaces of the <code>stl</code> mesh are translated into a mesh.
                </li>
                <li>run <code>snappyHexMesh</code><br>
                    This will use the inputs created in steps 1-3. Note that setting up for running <code>snappyHexMesh</code> in parallel is different from running in serial (i.e., one CPU core). Both setups will be described here.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>1. Defining the Background Mesh</h2>
            <p>This steps assumes that you know how to generate a simple mesh using the <code>blockMesh</code> utility. If you don't follow that guide first, and work through the excercises.</p>
            <p>The background mesh has to satisfy a few requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>cells ought to be approximately cubic within the vicinity of the <code>stl</code> mesh, otherwise <code>snappyHexMesh</code> will fail</li>
                <li>the background mesh must be positioned and sized such that the <code>stl</code> mesh is within it or located on the boundary</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Otherwise defining a mesh in a manner described on the <a href="https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/user-guide/4-mesh-generation-and-conversion/4.3-mesh-generation-with-the-blockmesh-utility"><code>BlockMesh</code> guide</a> is sufficient.</p>

            <h2>2. Creating an <code>stl</code> file</h2>
            <p>As noted above, the <code>stl</code> mesh must be created in a way such that it is located inside or on the boundary of the background mesh. In addition to that, the mesh must be structured nicely (the exact requirements I'm not sure of). When I first started out, I couldn't find a tool that created nice meshes and was also easy to use. But, instead I found tools that can create crappy meshes, and another tool that can turn these meshes into nice meshes.</p>
            <h3>a. Creating the basic shape</h3>
            <p>This step requires a Computer Aided Design (CAD) program. I found the following CAD programs to be basic, but free and perfectly fine for basic geometries:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://app.sketchup.com/app">SketchUp free</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgt2s9RzvKM">tutorial</a>)<br>
                    <code>stl</code> files can be exported using the "download" utility.
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://www.freecadweb.org/downloads.php">FreeCad</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVKhejma69U&list=PL4eMS3gkRNXeggvYq708Cm89Rg0PwAUuJ">tutorial series</a>)<br>
                    <code>stl</code> files can be exported using the "export" utility.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>b. Converting the mesh into something nice</h3>
            <p>The meshes the above tools create are not guaranteed to be nice e.g., meshes produced by the above utilities will have cells that are far from being equilateral.</p>
            <p>The tool that I found pretty easy to use and pickup is <a href="https://www.meshlab.net/">MeshLab</a>, but I found it to be pretty capable. To make a mesh nicer for use with <code>snappyHexMesh</code>, the "filters" dropdown list has a few tools that are pretty handy.</p>

                <figcaption>Original mesh produced by SketchUp of a baffle array (square columns). <code>snappyHexMesh</code> doesn't like the small angles between lines at the corners</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure>
                <img src="../../static/snappyhexmesh/baffles-meshlab-quad.png">
                <figcaption>Remeshing with MeshLab using Filters &#8594; Polygonal and Quad Mesh &#8594; Turn into Quad-Dominant mesh. Since the mesh faces are rectangular, a cell can occupy a whole face i.e., cell edges coincide with face edges.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure>
                <img src="../../static/snappyhexmesh/baffles-meshlab-isotropic.png">
                <figcaption>Remeshing with Meshlab using Filters &#8594; Remeshing, Simplification and Reconstruction &#8594; Remeshing: Isotropic Explicit Remeshing. While looking more complex, this mesh may be more preferred than the second figure above, as the triangles are closer to being equilateral.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <p>To save the remeshed mesh, you go to File &#8594; Export Mesh Asâ€¦ and choose to save it as an <code>stl</code> file. Save this to the project folder in <code>constant/triSurface/</code> with any name you like. </p>

            <h2>3. <code>surfaceFeatureExtract</code></h2>
            <p>Create the file <code>system/surfaceFeatureExtractDict</code> with the contents (modifying the mesh file name):</p>
