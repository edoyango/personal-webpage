         <h1>Oct - Dec 2016 India</h1>
         <p>This trip was part of a University subject that let you volunteer as report on your experiences. I chose to do a volunteer program with 40K Globe which lasted for a month. I spent a week either side of it travelling around.</p>
<h3 id="delhi">Delhi</h3>
<p>My colleague, Maivi, and I flew into Delhi where we would rendezvous with another volunteer, Karen. We flew in shortly after a festival, where they had set fireworks off everywhere in the city. Smog galore - I couldn&rsquo;t even breathe properly!</p>
<p>We arrived at our accomodation, Jugaad Hostels, around 9:30pm. We planned on staying here for two nights. After fighting jet lag (6h time difference) and getting whatever sleep we could, we spent the morning exploring the Hauz Khas District Park, a walkable distance from our Hostel. It&rsquo;s pretty cool that such cool ruins would exist in the middle of a city like Delhi. I&rsquo;m not sure what purpose it served in the past, but now it&rsquo;s a leisure area for the public and apparently a favourite makeout spot for teens.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we paid a visit to the Qutab Minar and the Lotus Temple, short rides by tuk tuk.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t say that these were spectacular times - I just recall being pretty tired from the jet leg haha!</p>

<h3 id="agra">Agra</h3>
<p>Like real tourists, our group decided to go on a &ldquo;golden triangle&rdquo; tour. This takes us to Agra (where the Taj Mahal is), Jaipur, and Delhi. We started the tour in Agra, getting their by train ourselves.</p>
<p>The train ride was packed, so pretty hectic getting on and off. But thankfully we had reserved beds, so didn&rsquo;t have to fight anyone for a spot. Once we got settled in, the train ride was very peaceful, aided by the slow motion rocking.</p>
<p>The haze from the festive fireworks gave the Taj Mahal and the castles a different aesthetic from what you usually see in the photos.</p>

<h3 id="jaipur">Jaipur</h3>
<p>Jaipur was the last leg of the Golden Triangle Tour. We were taken around by a tuk tuk driver who a colleague had recommended. He had stayed with us for the whole day and negotiated entry prices into some of the attractions. It was also helpful to not have to think about getting to places and where to eat.</p>
<p>Picking random tuk tuk drivers to take you around can be a bit of a hit-and-miss, so I recommend booking a tour with good reviews, or go with someone who&rsquo;s been recommended by someone you trust.</p>
<p>For women: many men in India will make very direct comments in an attempt to flirt, but they tone this down around men. Best to travel with a trusted guy friend if these make you uncomfortable. Best to rely on recommendations from other women as well.</p>
<p>The tour itself was great - we had tasty food popular with the locals, visited very well preserved marble temples and stepwells, and was taken to local stores for things like fabrics and jewellery.</p>

<h3 id="40k-globe">40K Globe</h3>
<p>The 40K Globe program is where I spent a month attending classes and lectures delivered by staff and the CEO of 40K, as well as helping setup &ldquo;40K Plus Pods&rdquo;. Overall, the program was very educational - seeing how the founder started the venture, obstacles he encountered, and things he learnt. But it was eye-opening to see in person, how much lower the quality of education is and how private sector efforts and technology improve outcomes. And all the while, getting to meet other students from other universities, each with their own interesting backgrounds. The only drawback for me, was the high cost (only a small part being subsidised by the university).</p>
<p>The project that we would help out with is to setup a 40K Plus Pod in a village periferal to Bangalore. These pods are an educational supplement to the daily classes for primary school children. The design was that there would be a single child minder, who would supervise the kids; and the kids would go through gamified lessons on low-cost tablets. The scope of our work would be to select a rental location from a provided shortlist, procure equipment and supplies for the pod from local sources, and to setup the space.</p>
<p>The program scope is quite limited and uncomplicated, so much to my disappointment, I wasn&rsquo;t changing the world. But, it was cooler than a normal &ldquo;voluntourism&rdquo; trip because a lot of the relational groundwork had been laid, and so we felt very welcome and had meaningful engagement with the community - we were even invited to the village&rsquo;s festival!. I think it&rsquo;s a really good (albeit expensive) way to be immersed in Indian culture, learn a bit about their systems, and challenge yourself by having to do some actual work in a completely different environment.</p>

<h3 id="40k-globe-weekend-1-madikeri">40K Globe Weekend 1: Madikeri</h3>
<p>I spent the first weekend in a bit of an out-of-the-way mountain town. I enjoy being in nature, so being stuck in a still very urban village was getting a bit old. I was a bit socially tired from the first couple weeks of the trip, so it was also good to be alone for awhile.</p>
<p>I spent a fair bit of time reading in the accomodation, which had a beatuful view of the hills. But I did go out at one point to go for a bike ride around town. I met up with a Master&rsquo;s student who was on break, and we visited a waterfall. I also had a look at the nearby park, which had an amazing view.</p>
<p>But overall, it was a thankfully pleasant, but unexciting weekend.</p>

<h3 id="40k-globe-weekend-2-dandeli-and-karwar">40K Globe Weekend 2: Dandeli and Karwar</h3>
<p>The second weekend of the 40K globe program was in Dandeli. This time I stayed at the Dandeli Kali Adventures resort with another program attendee. We went white-water rafting, visited waterfalls, and went on a boat tour. We did also go on a terribly disappointing jungle safari, which was disappointing because of the lack of animals! 5am wakeup for nothing! It was alright, but I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend someone go out of their way for it.</p>
<p>On the bus ride back to Bangalore, we made a detour to Karwar - a town on the west coast. We got there around lunch time and wandered around the beach, where there was a couple dudes giving people rides on a powered paraglider. Later in the evening, there happened to be a music festival, but we couldn&rsquo;t stay long because we needed to catch our overnight bus back to Bangalore. Again, not a &ldquo;go-out-of-your-way&rdquo; destination, but it was fun.</p>

<h3 id="40k-globe-weekend-3-hampi">40K Globe Weekend 3: Hampi</h3>
<p>Everyone on my program made a trip to Hampi at some stage. It&rsquo;s famous for ruins and hippies. Hampi has two parts, seperated by a river. On the side of the river you arrive from by bus, is the side with all the ruins and tourists. The other side is the where the hippies and younger tourists hang out. I got around both sides by motorbike. This I would highly recommend because the other alternatives are to go on a tour or reserver a tuk tuk driver for the day. The motorbike is not only more fun, but also cheaper! Although groups are better off with a tour or driver. The ferri across the river was also happy to take the motorbike onboard too.</p>
<p>I stayed on the ruins side of Hampi, but a bit away from where everyone else stayed. I was feeling like a bit of a princess, so I stayed at Heritage Resort Hampi (still only cost me 80 AUD a night). I did the ruins on the first day, and the hippy side on the second. The ruins were by far my favourite - apparently some of the world&rsquo;s oldest ruins (if not THE oldest), and an air of mystique, history, and religosity about it. A lot of the details in the marble statues were well-preserved and some sections (like the stepwells) have been restored. Was a bit challenging because it was very hot during the day, but beautiful nonetheless. The hippy side is where the hostels are and where you can visit shamans, try weed, and meet other &ldquo;like-minded&rdquo; folk. I spent the second day there, which required crossing the river by ferry. Besides hanging out in the stores and tents, I rode around further out from Hampi. I visited a swimming hole popular with locals, and a float tank &ldquo;startup&rdquo; created by a couple who used to work at Amazon.</p>
<p>Hampi is a must visit for people visiting India, but most people would be ok with 2-3 days. The hippies might enjoy a bit longer.</p>

<h3 id="post-40k-tour-rajasthan">Post 40K tour: Rajasthan</h3>
<p>After the 40K program, I went on a tour in the province of Rajasthan with two others from the program. We were taken around by a driver affiliated with the guy who took us around Jaipur. The tour started in Jaipur, took us to Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, and then Sikar, before returning to Jaipur. We spent only a short time in Jaipur as we already did most of it before the 40K program.</p>
<p>I would highly recommend Jodhpur and Jaisalmer, so you should prioritise thouse. Any of the others would by &ldquo;on-the-way&rdquo; destinations and just to help break up the long drive. They both have beautifully preserver ruins and of course, Jodhpur is famous for its blue painted buildings. Jaisalmer I liked very much because you could stay in the fort, and because we had a camel ride out to the desert to glamp under the stars overnight.</p>
