         <h1>Nov 2023 Thailand</h1>
         <p>What better way to celebrate the conclusion of my partner&rsquo;s first year of her master&rsquo;s degree than to relax in Thailand!
Unlike our last trip, this would be three weeks instead of one, giving us a lot more time to <em>relax</em> and see more during
the trip.</p>
<p>Same as last time, we flew in and out of Bangkok, but visited Chiang Mai in addition to Phuket in between.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also included my reading list for this trip (at the bottom).</p>
<p>We managed to get $250 return flights this time, but with the addition of 70,000 Qantas Frequent Flyer points
spend.</p>
<h3 id="bangkok-arrival">Bangkok (arrival)</h3>
<p>We got one less day in Bangkok than planned, because of the 1.5 day delay of our flight (thanks Jet Star&hellip;). Accounting
for the delay, we had a whopping 24h in Bangkok before catching the overnight train to Chiang Mai.</p>
<p>We arrived at around 10pm Bangkok time picked up our <a href="https://www.klook.com/en-AU/activity/16587-dtac-4g-sim-thailand/?spm=BookingDetail.ActivityCard&amp;clickId=a31828157b">online preordered sim cards</a> from the Klook kiosk at the aiport and
went straight to our accomodation. Our accomodation was an <a href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/35329051">AirBnB place</a> that
we chose mainly because it was cheap and on the airport rail line (i.e., easy to get to after our flight). It was basic,
but comfortable. And honestly, after a 9h flight and wrestling with the Bangkok heat and humidity, anywhere with a bed
and aircon was plenty. We finished the day with a visit to 7-eleven for water, and dinner via Food Panda delivery
(costing us $7.30 AUD for two meals and two drinks, including delivery!).</p>
<p>The next day we had three goals for the day before catching our train. Most critically, we needed to exchange our AUD
for THB. The other two less-critical tasks were to get a massage and try out a Michelin Bib-gourmand place located. Our
chosen cash exchange place was a <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/x8NDw6WGhKGZ9zgm6">Super Rich store</a> near the Central WOrld
shopping centre. Apparently it has consistently close to market exchange rates. Going to Central WOrld for us was super
convenient because we could take the bus, which was only 10 THB (~ 0.40 AUD) for each of us (a fraction of metro/ride
share).</p>
<p>After ticking off the money exchange item, we walked around the corner to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/UvbqhxkW4rAx3RbG7">Panda Spa and Massage</a>
to get a back, neck, and shoulder massage to heal us from last night&rsquo;s long plane ride. The masseuses were super strong
and really targetted the knots in our muscles! Although my partner woke up the next morning with bruses (and a
knot-free back). And to fuel up, we again walked around the corner to our Bib Gourmand choice: <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/UeEnub1e7uVwZCiL9">Kuang Heng Pratu Nam
Chicken Rice</a>, which, you guessed it, specialises in hainanese chicken rice.
I probably wouldn&rsquo;t recommend going out your way to visit, but the flavours are definitely tasty and unique, and
despite its looks, more than just a hole-in-the-wall chicken rice shop. Definitely worth visiting if you&rsquo;re in the area.</p>
<p>We made a short visit to The Market Bangkok, to escape the heat and get cold drinks, and subsequently spent the rest of
the afternoon exploring Central WOrld. Central WOrld seemed to be marketed to tourists and/or well-off Thai people, with
a lot of well-known western brand stores. Food on the top level also has a wide selection of local Thai food and
international cuisine (the latter being much more expensive). We were super excited to find that a Studio Ghibli
exhibition that we thought we had missed, had actually been extended into the new year! Because we needed to catch our
train to Chiang Mai, we decided to do it when we&rsquo;re back in Bangkok toward the end of the trip.</p>
<h3 id="bangkok-to-chiang-mai-via-overnight-train">Bangkok to Chiang Mai via Overnight Train</h3>
<p>Overnight trains are definitely not the fastest option as plains between Bangkok and Chiang Mai take around a couple
hours or so, and perhaps not the cheapest as busses as cheaper. Another criticism that I&rsquo;ve heard is that overnight
trains can often be delayed or cancelled, although that wasn&rsquo;t an issue for us. But I insisted on this because this
holiday was supposed to be relaxing, and there&rsquo;s something about watching the scenery pass by on a train that I find
relaxing.</p>
<p>We took the no. 9 train, which was the most comfortable overnight train at the time. There were faster trains available
but those meant arriving at 4am in the morning - not particularly convenient. Our train departed at 6:40pm with
expected arrival at 7:15am. We had a Thai friend help us book online, and we booked the second class option. Second
class consisted of booths with two chairs facing each other. And each of these booths could be turned into bunk beds.
The lower bunk gets the window (great if you&rsquo;re an early riser), whereas the top bunk doesn&rsquo;t. Power points are
available in both the seated and bunk beds configuration. <strong>Important tip</strong>: remember to bring an eye mask - lights are
kept on throughout the night. Ear plugs help too - We had issues with people talking in the middle of the night. We also
found the food on the train to be <em>relatively</em> expensive, so we brought our own food.</p>

<img src="/trips/img/trips-thailand2023/DSC_0009.jpg" alt="DSC_0009.jpg"  class="gallery" /></p>
<p>Next time, if I were to take the train again, I&rsquo;d consider booking at the ticket office rather than online. Apparently
the ticket office and online bookings have seperate pools of tickets (not sure why). When we booked online, we got the
last 2 of 3 tickets which were only top bunks. But, last minute travellers who booked at the office got bottom bunks.
Additionally, if travelling in two&rsquo;s, I might go in first class, which lets you share a cabin (still a bunk bed) with
two people, avoiding the noise and light issue, and at least one of you gets the window.</p>
<h3 id="chiang-mai">Chiang Mai</h3>
<p>After a surprisingly comfortable ride on the overnight train, we arrived in Chiang Mai at around 7:30am - greeted by
Tuk Tuk and taxi drivers trying to get tourists&rsquo; business. We opted (as many other did) to order a Bolt to minimize the
need for haggling and for a more comfortable and inexpensive ride. Throughout our stay in Chiang Mai, We stayed at an
AirBnB in the <a href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/39219424">Astra Condo</a>, which we liked because it was away from the
Chiang Mai old city, and consequently away from the noise; and because of the space. The pool was quite nice too.</p>
<p>Because of our goal to take it easy on this holiday, we generally did a couple things during the day, and left the
nights free - usually enjoying cheap delivery (via Food Panda) and beers from the nearby 7-eleven.</p>
<p>An unexpected trend we noticed in Chiang Mai, was that many locals could speak Chinese. Somewhat unexpected, given that
Thailand doesn&rsquo;t share a border with China; but convenient if you know Chinese.</p>
<h4 id="old-city">Old city</h4>
<p>The Chiang Mai old city is a classic destination for tourists, with heaps of Wats (temples) within walking distance,
coupled with tourist accomodation and eclectic restaurants/bars - all surrounded by a moat and remnants of the wall that
used to surround the city. We spent a couple mornings exploring the area and seeings Wats on Prapokkloa Rd - starting
from the Chiang Mai Gate. Those mornings, we grabbed breakfast from Chiang Mai Gate Market - experimenting with the
available local cuisine.</p>

<p>Besides eating the local cuisine, we also learnt to make it! We signed up for a cooking class on AirBnB experiences with
<a href="https://aromdiicooking.com/">Aromdii Cooking School</a> where we learnt how to make classic Thai soup, entree, main, and
dessert. They were great for teaching us about the ingredients that go into Thai cooking (a lot of spices), and how
sticky rice is made. The recipes are very forgiving, so great for beginners.</p>

<h4 id="doi-inthanon">Doi Inthanon</h4>
<p>On our third day in Chiang Mai, we hit the mountains on a rented scooter. To get our scooter, we originally planned on
getting one at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/D2+Bike+Changklan+Motorcycle/@18.7740557,98.9962704,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x30da3008bc0b0a0b:0x2928799a1c0b574f!8m2!3d18.7740506!4d98.9988453!16s%2Fg%2F11b76dncdz?entry=ttu">D2 Bike</a>,
since it was recommended by our AirBnB host. But, their inexpensive bikes were all rented out when we wanted one, so we
instead went to a place across the road. It cost us 250 THB per day, with a 1,000 THB deposit, and we needed to cover
our own petrol. This price and deposit amount seemed standard for scooter rentals. Our newfound independence enabled us
to visit <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Baan+Kang+Wat/@18.7763307,98.9461536,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x30da3135abcf1377:0x5b0f6ce47286ce9f!8m2!3d18.7763256!4d98.9487285!16s%2Fg%2F11c1plybwt?entry=ttu">Baan Kaang Wat</a> -
a village, located at the base of Doi Inthanon, that provides accomodation for craftsman and artists and a space for
them to sell their products; and Doi Suthep - a temple atop the mountain. The artists&rsquo; village had funny and fashionable
art pieces, postcards, jewellery, clothing, and more that would make a great place to buy souvenirs. Doi Suthep was
pretty crowded because of all the school kids on an excursion. In hinsdight, it would&rsquo;ve been good to visit a couple
more places on the mountainside like Doi Kham, and Huay Tueng Thao Resevoir. But we felt like we crossed off the main
items on our agenda for that day. We spent the rest of the day around MAYA shopping centre, getting a manicure, and
exploring shops around Chiang Mai Night Bazaar.</p>

<h4 id="elephant-nature-park">Elephant Nature Park</h4>
<p>Day four was spent entirely at Elephant Nature Park - selected because it claims to be the most ethical elephant park
and because it hosts other animals like water buffalo, dogs, and cows. It&rsquo;s unique in that Elephants are largely left to
roam the park and viewing is done from a distance. This is in contrast to other parks, which force elephants to be
ridden or to be bathed by tourists. The elephants adopted in the nature park are often elephants that previous owners
can no longer afford to take care of, or have been injured, rendering them unable to work. We did the skywalk day trip
which picked us up from our accomodation and took us around the main park in the morning, and showed us their other area
where new and/or young elephants are kept prior to being brought into the main park. We would highly recommend this park
as you know that the elephants are treated well. And while the intention is to let the elephants roam free, they do
occasionally come up to say hi (apparently they like sneaking up on the visitors!).</p>

<h3 id="phuket">Phuket</h3>
<p>Due to various ailments, we only really spent a couple days doing things in Phuket. But we tried to make the most of
the time we had where we were healthy!</p>
<p>We stayed opposite Rawai Beach, at <a href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/16129143">the Title - West Wing</a>, near the
southern-most tip of the main Phuket Island. Rawai beach itself is fairly mediocre as the beach is used by the
locals to dock their boats. It&rsquo;s also a little awkward to get to - it&rsquo;s the last stop on the Phuket Smart Bus from
the airport, which takes two hours! Taking a more direct route via taxi is half that. But the main advantages are
that it is far less touristy (although apparently becoming more gentrified), and serves as a great base to island
hop from, since you can ask any of the long-tail boat drivers on the road parallel to the beach front. There is also Yanui beach, which is a 15-ish minute scooter ride from Rawai beach. Generally, I would recommend this place to
stay if you planned to stay for awhile, wanted time away from the busier areas, and want to island hop.</p>
<p>The accomodation itself was good value and comfortable (about $40 AUD per night), but not for those who want views
and privacy.</p>
<h4 id="james-bond-island-phang-nga-bay-and-hong-island-by-canoe">James Bond Island, Phang Nga Bay, and Hong Island by canoe</h4>
<p>The day after arriving, we booked <a href="https://www.klook.com/en-AU/activity/3227-james-bond-day-tour-big-boat-longtail-speedboat">a Klook tour</a>
to explore Phang Nga Bay and Hong Island by canoe. It also made a stopover at James Bond Island although sightseeing
was done by foot. The canoeing would be done by guides, as the tour navigates through narrow caves and in between
jagged rocks, so it does take a bit of skill! Either way, it frees up your hands to take photos. On both our canoe
tours, we were guided by a local named Maricky (that&rsquo;s probably not the correct spelling, and we called him Ricky),
who did a great job pointing out interesting features (albeit in broken English), and made us an origami rose and
ring made with a reed leaf. We were ferried around on the big boat as my partner gets seasick. I would highly
recommend this tour for those who don&rsquo;t want to be in the water, and the big boat was great for avoiding getting
seasick.</p>

    There should have been a video here but your browser does not seem
    to support it.
</video>
<h4 id="bon-island-and-coral-island">Bon Island and Coral Island</h4>
<p>The other island hopping adventure we got to go on, is to Bon Island and Coral Island. Bon Island is a small island near
Rawai Beach and only takes 20 minutes or so by longtail boat to get to. Banana Beach is only a bit further out in the
same direction and takes around half an hour. We visited Coral Island first, and then Bon island on the way back. But I
would probably skip Bon Island altogether next time since the beach is smaller and not as great for snorkelling.</p>
<p>To arrange a boat, we simply talked to one of the guys standing next to the boat/island hopping signs sitting along
the road adjacent to Rawai beach. We talked to a guy at around 8am and asked for an 8:30 pickup from our accomodation,
which wasn&rsquo;t an issue, although such short notice was probably only possible because we were staying a 5 minute walk
from where he was posted. The return trip to Banana Beach and Bon Island cost us 1800 THB for the whole day (Banana
Beach alone would&rsquo;ve been 1500 THB). The boat trip also comes with snorkels to use. When you get to Banana Beach, using
the beach chairs and toilets requires a 100 THB per-person fee (more if you want to use the beds).</p>
<p>Because we left so early, we were one of the first to get to banana beach. We later also learnt that early is better
because the tide tends to be higher in the morning, and drops in the afternoon - making it more difficult to snorkel. We
spent most of the morning snorkelling and lounging in the chairs on banana beach. The snorkelling was surprisingly
really good! There was coral almost at the water front with a pretty good variety of fishes. But some of those fish will
bite you if you stay still or step on the coral (their homes)! We arrived around 9am and the place stayed pretty empty
until 10am.</p>
<p>Bon island didn&rsquo;t have nearly as good snorkelling, but while banana bay got pretty busy by the afternoon, Bon Island was
almost empty. On Bon Island, we mostly lazed around, explored the rockpools, and played with the hermit crabs on the
beach.</p>

<p>Gastronomy-wise, Phuket was a little lacklustre for us so there aren&rsquo;t any great food places we can recommend. Although,
if you&rsquo;re near Rawai beach, Sabai Massage was a pretty good experience if you&rsquo;re after a Thai massage.</p>
<h3 id="bangkok">Bangkok</h3>
<p>To make up for lost time, and thanks to the big basket of opportunities, we were quite busy in our time at Bangkok!
While in Bangkok, we stayed in the same area as last time - mainly because it was affordable and close to the Very
Festival we had tickets for. We stayed in an <a href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/928540985570442404">AirBnb pretty close to Asok station</a>,
which was spacious compared to the last time we were in Asok. Our host kindly let us check in early, so we didn&rsquo;t have
to faff around with finding somewhere to store our luggage.</p>
<h4 id="very-festival">Very Festival</h4>
<p>On the day of our arrival, we attended the Very Festival - a festival with a collection of mostly international artists,
with Joji being the headlining act. The festival ran across two days (starting from 12pm) in Queen Sirikit National
Convention Center (the man-made lake is a nice walk, if you&rsquo;re in the area!). Although it ran for two days, we only got
tickets for the second day. Even then, we decided that we only had the energy to see the last few acts which turned out
to be (in order):</p>
<ol>
<li>Bloc Party</li>
<li>Nothing But Thieves</li>
<li>Joji</li>
</ol>
<p>Bloc Party was bit ordinary - the lead singer had a bit of a bored look (admittedly, it was the last show of their
tour). It also doesn&rsquo;t help that their music is not really my taste. Nothing But Thieves were not bad - some of the
sounds in their songs reminded me of bands I listen to at least semi-regularly, like: Muse, Radiohead, and Maroon 5. My
partner also seemed to really like them. They also had really cool light and smoke effects going on, and the band had
good energy. A band I might explore more in the future. But, despite being the headline act, Joji was super
disappointing. The sound of the speakers weren&rsquo;t balanced, so instruments were drowning out voices (this was an issue
for all the acts, and probably depended on where you were standing); and he had this stupid supporting DJ (?) that would
inject &ldquo;ay ay ay&rdquo; in the middle of Joji&rsquo;s singing and make really bad jokes. We ended up leaving a couple songs into his
show.</p>
<p>But all in all, a fun experience (but hopefully not all concerts are this loud).</p>

<h4 id="getting-some-nice-silk-clothing">Getting Some Nice Silk Clothing</h4>
<p>One of my goals for Bangkok, was to get some nice Silk shirts, since Thailand is apparently well-known for their silk. I
thought having a silk shirt would be great for the upcoming summer in Melbourne. Our first attempt was to look around
Terminal 21, since that was nearby. But most of the stuff there was fast-fashion-esque, so definitely didn&rsquo;t have any
nice silk clothing.</p>
<p>Our next search spot was Old Siam Square. As the name suggests, Old Siam Square has a lot of &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; shops - including
the &ldquo;Silk Zone&rdquo;, apparently all reliable shops and tailors dealing in silk. But after strolling around and looking at
the available clothing they had. It was clear that they catered more toward <a href="https://www.etsy.com/au/listing/1288468173/2set-thai-traditional-silkset-for">formal wear</a>
or <a href="https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/175286147112">older style shirts</a> which wasn&rsquo;t what I was after. Apparently they can
tailor, given a reference, but we only had a few days left and wasn&rsquo;t sure that the shirts would be done in time.</p>
<p>While in the area, we also had stopped by two Bib Gourmand places - Sae Phun for stewed pork, and Kor Panit&rsquo;s Sticky
Rice for mango sticky rice.</p>
<p>My last choice was to go to Jim Thompson. This brand is apparently more popular with westerners, but not locals as the
clothing is apparently deemed too expensive (even for silk). But we decided to go to the outlet, which apparently has
much better deals than the main stores. The outlet is quite large, spanning 4 floors. I found the silk shirts on the 3rd
floor at a pretty good price and with nice patterns. But note that the silk stuff was mixed in with a lot of linen and
cotton stuff (which I thought was too expensive). My partner also managed to score a couple nice silk and linen dresses
for a pretty good price too.</p>

<h4 id="loy-krathong-festival-and-spectrum-sky-bar">Loy Krathong Festival and Spectrum Sky Bar</h4>
<p>After a successful haul of silk goods, we made a visit back to the lake next to Queen Sirikit National Convention Center
for the annual Loy Krathong Festival. For the Loy Krathong Festival, festival goers buy a bundle of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=loy+krathong+arrangement&amp;client=firefox-b-d&amp;sca_esv=587427479&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sxsrf=AM9HkKkjVF8n63CExlRP2dH9eqFxgt8itA:1701599898411&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjE-PnLifOCAxV4TmwGHSHvDfgQ_AUoAXoECAUQAw&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=711&amp;dpr=1.25">corn puff arrangements</a>
with a candle and incense. They light the candle and incense, and release it into the waters of a nearby river or lake
to thank the Goddess of Water and River, Goddess Khongkha. We realised that the arrangements are made from corn puffs so
that they eventually disintegrate into the water, and the body of water isn&rsquo;t completely covered with these
arrangements. We saw a large number of people come to the lake to release and to watch and it was a cool thing to see.</p>
<p>We finally ended the night by making a visit to Spectrum sky bar that sits atop the Grand Hyatt Sukhumvit. It was a
monday night at around 6:30pm when we got there, so it was completely dead - we were the only people in the bar. The
vibe was clearly a little dull, but the views were amazing.</p>

<h4 id="studio-ghibli-exhibit-in-centralworld">Studio Ghibli Exhibit in CentralwOrld</h4>
<p>Something we had to do when we came back to Bangkok was to visit the Studio Ghibli Exhibit on the top floor of the
CentralwOrld shopping mall. Each room in the exhibit consisted of life-sized diarama of scenes from 7 Ghibli films, some
of which were setup so you could pose and take pictures.</p>
<p>The end of the exhibit showed Studio Ghibli&rsquo;s animation process, using real storyboards used when creating My Neighbour
Totoro. Apparently, a unique aspect of Ghibli films is that dialogue is created after storyboards are drawn, when
animation studios usually do it the other way round.</p>

<p>While in the area, we took the opportunity to look around The Platinum Fashion Mall (apparently popular with young
people, probably because of the inexpensive and large variety of clothing and accessories), Samyan Mitrtown (another
mall), and a relatively inexpensive Omakase restaurant (<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kozue+Omakase+Samyan/@13.7348603,100.5250895,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x30e2995bf3fbf0ad:0x1a63c80db27191bc!8m2!3d13.7348551!4d100.5276644!16s%2Fg%2F11nxpynlk1?entry=ttu">Kozue Omakase, Samyan branch</a> - book by Facebook).</p>
<h4 id="happy-birds-day">Happy Bird&rsquo;s Day</h4>
<p>We stumbled across this bird cafe near Ekkamai station and it was the cutest thing ever! It cost 350 THB which includes
food to feed the birds and other animals, a drink, and a printed photo (as a polaroid). A warning - you&rsquo;re best off
wearing a moderately thick long sleeve (cut-resistant gloves may also come in handy) and no loose accessories, because
the birds will try to rip them off!</p>
<p>When you walk in, you&rsquo;re immediately greeted by birds eager to jump onto you for food, but beware the Cockatoos! They
seem to love ripping things off your clothing - they ripped off a button off my partners hat, and tried to rip off one
of my piercings! If it becomes too much, you can make your way into the next room which has cushions to sit on and is
devoid of animals. The backyard has ducks, fluffy chickens, bunnies, hamsters, and the entrance to another bird
enclosure. The minders are very kind and helpful, and will help you catch the ducks to take a photo with, and to also
help you take photos. The bird enclosure has many colourful (with varying degrees of agressiveness), who will happily
perch on you for photos (one hung out in my hair for awhile).</p>
<p>A highly recommended experience if you love animals! Across the road also has a dog cafe, although it was empty at the
time.</p>

<h3 id="my-reading-list-in-order-of-completion">My Reading list (in order of completion)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Career and Family by Claudia Goldin</li>
</ol>
<p>I first encountered Prof. Claudia&rsquo;s work in my undergraduate days when I heard about the stat that &ldquo;women make 83 cents
for every dollar earnt by a man&rdquo;. I decided to revisit her ideas by reading this book because she had won this year&rsquo;s
Nobel Prize in Economics.</p>
<p>This book, using ample primary evidence, lays out how the narratives for college-educated women changes over the past
century, when it comes to choosing career and/or having children. She starts with &ldquo;group 1&rdquo;, who could only chose career
OR having children, explicitly through legislation like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_bar">&ldquo;Marriage bars&rdquo;</a>.
After removing explicit barriers, introduction of viable female-controlled contraceptive devices and technology that
reduces household labour, and increased demand for labour (e.g., during WW2 when men went off to war), women eventually
make their way to the present day group (group 5) who can choose to have career AND children.</p>
<p>She argues that the current gender gap is <em>mostly</em>, but not <em>entirely</em>, driven by the fact that high-paying jobs tend
to be &ldquo;greedy jobs&rdquo; and it is impossible to have a greedy job and be a primary caretaker at the same time. Greedy jobs
apparently result in higher pay both because of the more hours worked, but also these jobs are payed <em>more per hour</em>
because workers are effectively on-call, hours are inconsistent, and more time in the profession tends to be rewarded by
clients. The examples of high paying greedy jobs Prof. Claudia uses are doctors, lawyers, consultants, and investment
bankers. She argues that bias against women is unlikely to be a <em>large</em> factor for the pay gap because her data shows
that women who are not a primary caretaker (e.g., women without children, or the breadwinner in a same-sex
marriage/parentship) earn only a bit less than what men do.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the book, she highlights changes currently happening and further changes needed to reduce the cost of
dropping out of these traditionally greedy jobs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consulting firms are finding that early-career women are leaving to become caretakers, which is unecomical for the firms due to brain drain and wasted training, and so are raising the &ldquo;substitutability&rdquo; of workers and introducing work-life-balance measures, which Prof. Claudia argues is critical to keeping women working in well-paid careers.</li>
<li>Having workers on call isn&rsquo;t strictly necessary, and changes in the system can reduce the need for workers to be on-call. For example: vets used to be small-businesses only and owners would be on call, and eventually they moved to small-businesses would be 9-5, but a centralised facility would be available 24/7 for emergencies, which would have vets on a roster, so nobody would have to be on call (also similar to how GPs work with emergency departments).</li>
<li>Lower the cost of child care, so the primary caretaking partner (usually the wife in heterosexual couples) doesn&rsquo;t need to take time off.</li>
<li>alter societal norms, so it isn&rsquo;t always the woman being the primary caretaker.</li>
</ul>
<p>I liked this book as it gave a lot more clarity to gender economic inequity. Popular discourse tends to be lazy in how
they discuss it by attributing the inequity to abstract and not measurable concepts like &ldquo;the patriarchy&rdquo;, &ldquo;sexism&rdquo;; and
instead it writes a narrative based on primary data for what has happened and what is happening. I&rsquo;m not saying that we
don&rsquo;t live in a patriarchical society that can enforce gender norms, or that there isn&rsquo;t sex bias in our society, but
that by providing a mechanism to phenomena like the gender pay gap, provide a far more useful way to discuss it, as well
as address it. I think that Prof. Claudia provides a very clear and easy to understand view of the gender pay gap, and
provides some guidance on how it can be addressed. I also appreciate that later in the book, she treats the issues as
arising from couples&rsquo; situations and decisions (rather than attributing the issue to the patriarchy or sexism in a
hand-wavy manner), as well as acknowledging that men generally prefer being present as fathers and lament when they are
not. Finally, I think the comments and solution towards the end provide good guidance for which policies to promote if
we want live (and work) in a world where both parents have the opportunity to take care of their kids, without losing long-term income.</p>
<p>Overall, a good and intuitive, albeit dense read. A must read for anyone seeking specificity and clarity on the gender
pay gap, and the strides women have made and the challenges they still face.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Of Boys and Men by Richard Reeves</li>
</ol>
<p>I found this book on <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/12/06/these-are-the-economists-best-books-of-2022">The Economist Reads</a> as they recommended it as one of their best books to read from 2022. At
first, I just wanted to make sure I had a look at issues facing men (especially since I&rsquo;m a man), but it turned out to
be a much needed read, after reading Claudia Goldin&rsquo;s book, to remind myself that men also have a story to tell.</p>
<p>Dr. Richard Reeves uses a combination of primary data, secondary data, and others&rsquo; writings to highlight issues facing
modern men and boys. In addition to describing issues, he also makes an effort to be apolitical, but does indeed address
the differences in the more <em>extreme</em> left and right wing views (US) surrounding gender issues. He tries to carefully
highlight that while women do indeed experience challenges, men&rsquo;s outcomes in very recent history, are worsening for a
variety of reasons. He occasionally criticizes the state of public discourse and policy around gender issues to be
biased in the favour of women as efforts to address mens issues are assumed to be detracting from women&rsquo;s or LGBTIQA+
issues, and instead argues that &ldquo;we can hold two thoughts at once&rdquo; and &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t a zero-sum game&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The main issues that I see him identifying throughout the book are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biological sex differences in childhood and adolescences leads to learning differences in boys and girls (current schooling timelines apparently suit girls better than boys). Women have also overtaken men by a wide margin in college enrolment and completion (and men who do complete take longer, on average).</li>
<li>Agender policies (e.g., policies that waive college fees for everyone) unintentionally benefit women much more than men</li>
<li>Work that men have traditionally gone into (often manual labour) are currently being automated and many men are not re-entering the work force</li>
<li>Gender roles assigned to men have yet to move on from men being economic providers - problematic in a world where women can provide for themselves, and in a world where traditionally male jobs are disappearing (see above)</li>
<li>Gender expectation prevent males from being retrenched into HEAL (Health, Education, Administration, Literacy) jobs, despite evidence to suggest that having male teachers (for example), could improve outcomes for boys in schools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Richard suggests that these issues can be solved in tandem, and often result in win-win-win situations (win for men,
win for their partners and/or children, and win for society writ large). The clearest example being getting men into
HEAL jobs removing the stereotype that men cannot be carers. This would provide more jobs for men; make it socially
acceptable for men to be more involved in child care and reduce the expecation on women to be primary child carers; help
boys in schools (boys apparently benefit from having male teachers, and girls&rsquo; outcomes aren&rsquo;t affected); and society
benefit by filling jobs in a sector that has huge job growth (apparently 3 HEAL jobs are created for every STEM job).</p>
<p>A couple solutions that he proposes seem actionable, in that they are simple to implement (adminstratively), but may
require a bit of persuasion. For example, he proposes that we &ldquo;redshirt&rdquo; boys i.e., have all of them start school a year
later due to boys&rsquo; cognitive development being delayed in childhood and adolescence compared to girls. This is already
being done on an ad-hoc basis, especially in affluent schools. Furthermore, there is ample evidence supporting this
policy. When talking about getting men into HEAL jobs, Dr. Reeves suggests that policy-makers should mimic initiatives
used by campaigns to get girls into STEM jobs - such as, getting speakers at school to raise awareness of men in
HEAL, introduce summer programs, and introducing quotas in HEAL - similar to those implemented for women in STEM. But
he seems to draw short in identifying actionable solutions for resolving gender issues. It seems that women (according
to Claudia Goldin&rsquo;s narrative), needed barriers removed to progress in closing the gap, but data used in this book
suggests that men are also facing identity and motivation issues.</p>
<p>I liked this book a lot for multiple reasons. Firstly, it echoed, validated, and explained things that I noticed in high
school and uni - like how girls were more switched on and motivated than me and most other males I knew. I respect how
hard the author tries to avoid presenting boy/men&rsquo;s issues as being in competition with girl/women&rsquo;s issues. And I
appreciate how he highlights that particularly lower class men&rsquo;s incomes are decreasing, whereas this isn&rsquo;t the case for
same-classed women. Or you could frame it as &ldquo;men&rsquo;s problems are that those at the bottom are becoming worse off,
whereas women&rsquo;s problems are that it is almost impossible to get in the top&rdquo;. Most importantly, I feel like the book
does a lot to give voice to issues affecting large swathes of men, like the change in gender roles, and the loss of
income. It highlights the discrepency in how men&rsquo;s issues are treated - men&rsquo;s issues are ignored (evident by lack of
government and non-profit entities campaigning for men&rsquo;s issues), and women&rsquo;s issues are apparently caused by men. And
finally, it shows that men have a lot of gaps to close with women too - like in education, mental health, and identity.</p>
<p>I found this book easier to read than Prof. Claudia&rsquo;s, probably owing to the fact that Claudia has always been
an academic, that Dr. Reeve typically writes in non-academic spaces, but also because the issues highlighted in the book
resonate a bit more with me (being a male). I found this book very personally meaningful, but generally interesting
because it highlights issues facing men that I wasn&rsquo;t aware of. It was also useful to get a bit of an insight for how
men experiencing these issues could be drawn into and taken advantage of by right wing and online toxic communities.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Sightseeing by Rattawut Lapcharoensap</li>
</ol>
<p>I chose to read this book because I wanted to read a book about Thailand without being about tourism. It was also my
fiction/easy read break in between reading the above two books. Importantly, this book was written by a Thai person
(US born, Bangkok raised), which was special because all other English books I could find were written by westerners and
paid a lot of attention to Bangkok&rsquo;s sex trade for some reason.</p>
<p>The book has 6 short stories and a novella - all based in Thailand, and mostly from the perspective of a Thai person.
But the settings were different each time, offering different slices of life in different places, at different times.</p>
<p>Most of these stories were quite perplexing to me - not because of their somber tone, but because of how tragic the
characters&rsquo; circumstances are. They&rsquo;re mostly low socio-economic status and their environment is just so different from
the one I grew up in - in the stories financial insecurity was pervasive, single parenthood was in a couple, early
sexualisation and harrassment, racism, and the list goes on. But each of the stories, these adversities are viewed
through a lense of naivete - which made me wonder: how common are these issues in Thailand really?</p>
<p>But I thought the books were interesting for another reason - they portray viewpoints from different &ldquo;kinds&rdquo; of Thai
people. In the first story, Farang, the show how local Thai people living on a tourist island view the western tourists,
which, in the story, is with infatuation (the protagonist&rsquo;s feelings), or with hesitation and resentment (some of the
other local&rsquo;s feelings). In the last story (the novella), more interactions between characters in a town are fleshed
out, highlighting the complex dynamic in a small town with limited opportunity and law enforcement.</p>
<p>Overall, as a fan of somber slice of life&rsquo;s, I really enjoyed the book. I&rsquo;m not sure how common stories like the ones
told in the book are (although ChatGPT4 tells me it&rsquo;s very authentic to Thai&rsquo;s experience), but I would recommend it for
anyone looking to experience Thailand from a more local and realistic lense.</p>
