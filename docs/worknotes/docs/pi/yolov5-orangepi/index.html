  Combining the Orange Pi 5 Pro and YOLOv5 for bird detection
  #

I started this project to record and identify the birds that we saw on our verandah throughout the day, as well as an
excuse to learn about object detection. I aimed at using YOLO mainly because the ultralytics package is very easy to
use and the performance-accuracy tradeoff was good.
When I first got started, it was quite easy to play with ultralytics and its latest iterations of YOLO on my laptop,
but my main constraint was that I didn&rsquo;t have any machines that were a good (and affordable) candidate to process the
videos. This was mainly because inference on GPUs was fairly resource intensive and we needed the GPUs for other daily
resource-intensive use cases like gaming, work, or image/video editing.">

  Combining the Orange Pi 5 Pro and YOLOv5 for bird detection
  <a class="anchor" href="#combining-the-orange-pi-5-pro-and-yolov5-for-bird-detection">#</a>
</h1>
<p>I started this project to record and identify the birds that we saw on our verandah throughout the day, as well as an
excuse to learn about object detection. I aimed at using YOLO mainly because the <code>ultralytics</code> package is very easy to
use and the performance-accuracy tradeoff was good.</p>
<p>When I first got started, it was quite easy to play with <code>ultralytics</code> and its latest iterations of YOLO on my laptop,
but my main constraint was that I didn&rsquo;t have any machines that were a good (and affordable) candidate to process the
videos. This was mainly because inference on GPUs was fairly resource intensive and we needed the GPUs for other daily
resource-intensive use cases like gaming, work, or image/video editing.</p>
<p>So at first, I was recording webcam videos of our verandah, uploading them to google drive, downloading them to the HPC
I had at work, and then processing them using the under-utilized GPUs on the HPC. This worked pretty well - except that
I changed job, and no longer have access to free and available GPU compute. So what was I to do!</p>
<p>I knew that the 
  <a href="https://turingpi.com/product/turing-rk1">RK1</a> chips existed which used the RK3588 chip, which had an
NPU built into it. From searching the web, I discovered that the RockChip NPU supported many object detection
frameworks - including all the recent YOLO frameworks (see the

  <a href="https://github.com/airockchip/rknn_model_zoo">RKNN model zoo</a>)! My original expectation was that I would buy three RK1
modules - two to perform object detection and the third for any peripheral needs like work management, post-processing,
file upload/download etc. So, <strong>The Orange pi 5 Pro was originally intended for testing before I got multiple RK1
modules, but turns out the lone SBC was enough!</strong> This turned out to be because the NPU has 3 cores, so I can
perform inference on multiple video feeds, and the hardware accelerated FFMPEG encoding is very fast!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example GIF of the output (compressed in a few ways):</p>
<p>
  <img src="/worknotes/imgs/sample.gif" alt="Example output of inference output" /></p>
<p>Here I&rsquo;ve documented the setup steps for future reference.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">
  Requirements
  <a class="anchor" href="#requirements">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The core objective was to <strong>perform real-time object detection on two webcam video feeds</strong>. In a little more detail,
this meant I needed the setup to be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Perform inference on the video feeds at a resolution of 704x396 @ 10fps using a medium sized YOLO model</li>
<li>save and encode/compress bird-containing segments of the video feed</li>
</ol>
<p>704x396 resolution and medium model were chosen by experimenting and finding a balance between speed and accuracy. The
cameras could record at over 30 FPS, but 10 FPS was chosen as it reduced storage space significantly (videos were being
kept for future model training).</p>
<p>On an NVIDIA A30 GPU, the object-detection alone usually took roughly 2h to process 20h of video feed (2 webcams
recording for 10h).</p>

<p>I used two of the same 
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B0B6QV5SVW">2MP webcam with zoom</a> so I could get a good view of the
platforms we had setup on the verandah for the birds. Using regular non-zoom webcams (e.g. what you would use for
meetings), meant the birds were way too small on the feed and it was challenging for the model, as well as to label
images. Sometimes the birds were only a handful of pixels!</p>
<h3 id="orange-pi-5-pro">
  Orange Pi 5 Pro
  <a class="anchor" href="#orange-pi-5-pro">#</a>
</h3>
<p>I chose the Orange Pi 5 Pro mainly because:</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t need many peripherals as it was acting as a server (just needed USB ports)</li>
<li>Was cheaper than the Ultra/Max</li>
<li>Had faster memory than the normal Orange Pi 5</li>
</ul>
<p>I got the 8GB model as I guesstimated I needed roughly 4.5GB for inference. I arrived at this number by adding together
the CPU RAM and GPU RAM usage while doing inference with the ultralytics package.</p>
<p>I bought the Orange Pi 5 Pro itself on Taobao while I was in China, which had roughly the same sticker price as if I had
bought it off Aliexpress from Australia, but I wouldn&rsquo;t have to pay shipping fees or import taxes. If you&rsquo;re buying it
outside of China, Aliexpress prices seemed to be much better than Amazon.</p>
<p>I bought the Orange Pi 5 Pro with the charger as it required a minimum of 5A and 5V which wasn&rsquo;t that easy to find
cheaply.</p>
<p>To keep the Orange Pi cool, I bought a 
  <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001866650684.html">copper plate cooler with fan (4-fans)</a>
as it didn&rsquo;t take much for the Pi to overheat and throttle itself.</p>
<h3 id="storage">
  Storage
  <a class="anchor" href="#storage">#</a>
</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using a 32GB SD Card that I had from previous Raspberry Pi projects and the SD card stores most of the root
partition. I also repurposed an old external hard drive to store the recorded video data.</p>
<h3 id="a-note-about-training">
  A note about training
  <a class="anchor" href="#a-note-about-training">#</a>

<p>Training cannot be done on the NPU, so you&rsquo;ll need to have seperate hardware to perform the model training.</p>

<p>To start off, I used 
  <a href="https://etcher.balena.io/">Balena Etcher</a> to flash the SD card with the 
  <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KnmBQ3Z0M_5snRC24LjhKb8_tKbcfOkw">official server image</a>.
Unfortunately, unlike the Raspberry Pi, I couldn&rsquo;t find a way to pre-configure the WiFi headless, so I had to do it with
the screen and keyboard plugged in. Note that the default user and password is <code>orangepi</code>. The image does come with the
<code>orangepi-config</code> utility which makes connecting to the WiFi <em>a little</em> easier.</p>

<p>Once the Pi was setup and running, I needed to update the RKNN library by downloading the latest binary (which for some
reason, is stored on 
  <a href="https://github.com/airockchip/rknn-toolkit2/blob/master/rknpu2/runtime/Linux/librknn_api/aarch64/">their GitHub</a>).</p>

<p>I use FFMPEG to perform the video encoding and compression needed in my pipeline. If you want to use FFMPEG for encoding
using hardware acceleration, you&rsquo;ll need to build one from source. The instructions

<p>Training a new model can be done by using 
  <a href="https://github.com/airockchip/yolov5">RKNN&rsquo;s customized fork of YOLOv5</a>. I
personally use Roboflow to label my images. If using Roboflow, make sure that the directory structure and annotations
are compatible with the YOLOv5 format. In Roboflow, this is an option that you can choose when downloading your dataset.
Note you cannot practically do training on the NPU, so as mentioned, you&rsquo;ll need seperate hardware to perform training.</p>
<p>The instructions below you have an NVIDIA or AMD GPU installed in the appropriate manner for your hardware.</p>

  <a href="https://github.com/airockchip/rknn_model_zoo/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#model-performance-benchmarkfps">model performance benchmark table</a>,
which show that all the newer YOLO models have usable performance (e.g., they say that yolo11m has 12.7 FPS). But, this
only accounts for the time spent on the NPU, but doesn&rsquo;t include pre- and post-processing which is done on the CPU.
Besides some image processing, post-processing also includes steps that couldn&rsquo;t run on the NPU, such as using the
softmax function. <strong>The softmax function is used by YOLOv6 and above and is the bottleneck for using these models on the
RK3588.</strong> So while the performance table says that <code>yolo11s</code> has 33 FPS, including the pre- and post-processing, I was
getting around 10FPS. And note that the PyTorch softmax function already uses multiple threads, so it is challenging to
accelerate.</p>

<p>When using the <code>convert.py</code> script in the example, the model only accepts singular inputs (i.e., batch size of 1). You
can enable batches by updating the

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will require updating the <code>yolov5.py</code> example script too, if you wish for that to work. The 
  <a href="https://github.com/airockchip/rknn_model_zoo/blob/main/examples/yolov5/python/yolov5.py#L236">main loop</a>
needs to be changed so that batches are passed to the pre-processing step, the model, and the post-processing step.</p>
<p><strong>I found that using a batch size of 16 increased throughput of inference (EXCLUDING pre- and post-processing) by
roughly 2.5x.</strong> While this was significant, I didn&rsquo;t find it necessary, as I found that <code>yolov5m</code> with <code>imgsz=704</code> was
sufficient was achieving a performance that was satisfactory for my use case.</p>

  Multi-core inference

<p>As alluded to in the <code>rknn_model_zoo</code> performance table, the RK3588 has multiple cores. By default, inference uses only
one of thoses cores, but you can use all the cores if necessary. This requires changing the 
  <a href="https://github.com/airockchip/rknn_model_zoo/blob/main/py_utils/rknn_executor.py#L12">utility code in the model zoo that initializes the model</a>.</p>

<p>To build a container that can use the NPU, the only thing that must be done is installing the driver (

If hardware accelerated FFMPEG is needed, that needs to be built inside the container too.</p>

<ul>
<li>I could potentially run larger models (or use higher resolution input) by leveraging the acceleration notes above.
<ul>
<li>batch processing would require that I change the main loop. It could also limit my applications e.g. in case I
want to stream my feed(s), how frames are read/processed/written need to be thought about to ensure a smooth feed.</li>
<li>multi-core inference may handicap my ability to perform inference on two feeds at once</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use an NVME drive instead of an external HDD. This would be more for form factor than performance, as IO isn&rsquo;t a
bottleneck.</li>
