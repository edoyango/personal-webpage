This covers any work/study involving the [CFDEM software](https://www.cfdem.com/media/CFDEM/docu/CFDEMcoupling_Manual.html), and its component tools: [OpenFOAM](https://www.openfoam.com/) and [LIGGGHTS](https://www.cfdem.com/media/DEM/docu/Manual.html). Respectively, these software packages perform Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and granular materials (e.g., sand and pills) simulations. LIGGGHTS simulates granular materials using the Discrete Element Method (DEM). CFDEM is the combination of these two tools, and aims to perform coupled CFD-DEM simulations i.e., simulations of granular materials immersed in fluid. Notes below cover all three software packages. Note that these pages only cover the open source versions of CFDEM and LIGGGHTS (OpenFOAM does not have a paid version).

This stuff I learnt after I graduated from my masters, and was done under the supervision of [Nhu Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IZuUn6YAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) in my free time. I only work on this intermittently.
