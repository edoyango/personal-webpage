# GraSPH Documentation

GraSPH is a hobby project of mine that builds on the work I did with SPH in my masters. You can download the code from [my GitHub](https://github.com/edoyango/GraSPH), where there is also a README which you can use to get started.

## This Page
Provides more detailed documentation than in the GitHub README. It will help you create your own geometry. In the future, I aim to add documentation that explains the code structure and how to modify the code. Topics are on the menu on the left. If you have feedback (for the docs or the code), don't hestiate to [open an issue on the GitHub](https://github.com/edoyango/GraSPH/issues/new), or [email me](mailto://edward_yang_125@hotmail.com). But keep in mind I do this in my free time.
