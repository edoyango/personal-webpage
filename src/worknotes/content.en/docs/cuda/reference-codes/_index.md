A collection of downloadable sample codes from the [CUDA Fortran for Scientists and Engineers book](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780124169708/cuda-fortran-for-scientists-and-engineers) and a rough translation into C++.

Might put in the real examples at a later date. E.g., estimating pi via Monte-Carlo methods, option pricing, FDM, p2p and MPI GPU matrix transpose, FFTs, and Poisson solver.
