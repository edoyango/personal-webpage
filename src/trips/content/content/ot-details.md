This page is dedicated to describing all the equipment I brought (and wish I brought), all the costs of the trip (not including equipment and food), and the food I brought (and wish I brought)
<!--more-->

### Costs

Track fees (at time of purchase):
* track fee - $200
* parks pass fee ($82.40 for 1 vehicle for 2 months, which covered the family's other park visits in Tasmania)
* ferry from Narcissus Hut to Lake St Clair Visitor Centre - $55

transport costs to Cradle Mountain Visit Centre (start of OT), and from Lake St Clair Visitor Centre (end of OT):
* $98 each way with Overland Track Transport (a third party company), which includes cancellation insurance

**Sum total (excl. food and equipment): AU$533.40**

Besides the track fee and parks pass fee, all the other costs are optional in that you can avoid them with extra effort. The ferry from Narcissus Hut to Lake St Clair can be substituted with another 17.5km of walking (flat, with forest terrain) via Echo Point. The bus transport to and from the hike can be avoided if you have multiple cars e.g., you have two cars, leave one at Lake St Clair, and use the other to drive to the start of the hike. Note that Overland Track Transport can take you from Lake St Clair to Launceston, and then to Cradle Mountain Visitor Centre the following morning, but you have to pay for each leg - thus not saving any money. I suspect other companies are similar.

### Equipment

* pack: XX from Denali (bought many years ago - did the job, but wish it had more external attachment points)
* tent: XX from Denali (bought many years ago - did the job, but wish it was lighter)
* sleeping bag: Camper Sleeping Bag 4 from Kathmandu (was a little cold)
* sleeping bag liner: cotton sleeping bag liner from Kathmandu (did the job)
* sleeping mat: Lansan Light Air Mat from Kathmandu (inflatable, pretty comfortable, but a little noisy when moving)
* hiking clothing:
    * 1x synthetic fleece jacket from Colombia (pretty warm and would recommend)
    * 1x rain jacket: GORE-TEX Minimalist Jacket from Marmot (did well to protect from wind and rain and would recommend)
    * 2x hiking t-shirts from Mountain Designs (have had these for awhile. I like that they dry pretty quickly but have a good thickness)
    * 1x hiking pants, convertable to shorts, from Kathmandu (was a bit annoyed at how quickly it soaked up water)
    * 2x pairs of hiking socks: Trekking Plus from Mountain Designs and XX from Falke (I really like the Falke socks. The other pair I brought caused problems for my feet)
    * 5x pairs of generic underwear
    * 1x hiking shoes: Moab Speed GTX from Merrell (the shoes had great grip, waterproofing and sturdiness. Would recommend)
    * 1x hooded top from Kathmandu (I never used this on OT, but I do like it for being breathable and lightweight)
    * 1x bandana - good for covering neck from sun or absorbing sweat from head.
    * 1x neck buff
* non-hiking clothing:
    * 1x shorts (which could be used to swim)
    * 1x thermal top
    * 1x thermal bottom
* prescription glasses and prescription sunglesses (I'm short-sighted)
* electronics:
    * DSLR Camera (D3300 from Nikon - did not need to charge)
    * Watch: Fenix 5S from Garmin (did not record any times and was at 25% battery at the end of the trek)
    * CPAP: ResMed AirMini travel CPAP
    * CPAP battery which doubles as a charger for watch and phone: Pilot 24 from MediStrom (enough for two nights of the CPAP)
    * Solar panels: 50W solar panels from MediStrom (took about 4h of direct sunshine for a full charge, much much longer if weather is overcast)
    * My daily-use smartphone (hint: turn phone into aeroplane mode and ultra-battery saver mode to save battery - you should still be able to take photos with it)
* toiletries:
    * 1x roll of toilet paper (had about 1/3rd left)
    * 6x wet wipes (should've just brought the whole box)
    * toothbrush, floss, toothpaste
    * hand sanitizer
* 2x 1L plastic bottles filled up at the start of each day at the huts

I wish I brought/had:

* a lightweight chair (like this one)
* satellite messenger thing (like this one from garmin)
* a lighter backpack (like this one)
* a lighter tent (like this one)
* hiking poles
* a water bladder - more space efficient

### Food and Cooking

breakfast for each day:
* approx. 1 cup of quick oats with 2 tbsp of Coles milk powder and 1 tsp sugar
* 1 Vittoria packet instant coffee (taken from a hotel), 1 tsp sugar, 1 tbsp of Coles milk powder

lunch for each day:
* 5 large slices of spicy salami
* 2 slices sliced Gouda cheese from Coles
* 10 crackers

dinner for each days:
* meal 1:
    * half packet of Coles dehydrated peas
    * dehydrated mash potatoes (enough to make ~1 cup after hydrating)
    * Continental Soup Sensations Tomato & Ricotta packet
* meal 2:
    * half packet of Coles dehydrated peaks
    * Continental Soup Sensations Pumpkin and Sour Cream
    * 1 Mi Goreng packet

snacks:
* beef jerky (got stolen by birds on day 1)
* dehydrated apricot snacks (got stolen by birds on day 1)
* trail mix (goji berries, cranberries, banana chips, almonds, walnuts, cashews) - about 150g per day
* various tea bags (1 bag a day)

cooking:
* Furno Stove form 360 Degree
* Jetpower 230g gas canister from Jetboil which can attach to stove from above
* X-pot Kettle from Sea to Summit (this is collapsible, which is handy, but I was shown that there are much lighterweight pots that gas canisters can fit inside of, which removes the need for collapsibility)
* matches to light the gas stove

hydration:
* Aquatab water purifying tablets
* a few leftover hydralyte packets

Each day worked out to be just under 8000kJ (or ~2000 kCal), which was less than half of what I was burning each day. Next time I would bring:
* my own dehydrated meals (more calories without paying the high cost of freeze dried meals)
* candy (buying lunch-box sized bags would be a good way to portion control)
* tastier packet drinks like hot chocolate/mocha/chai
* more gatorade powder - maybe enough to make 1L per day
* maybe a water filter would be better than the purifying tablets - I didn't like the pool-water taste it imparted
