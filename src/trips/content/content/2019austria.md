I was in Austria for a workshop in Vienna for my Masters. Besides Vienna, I made stops to Insbruck, and Salzburg (where the Sound of Music was shot).

### Wienn (AKA Vienna)
I started in Vienna, attending the workshop. I spent one whole day in Vienna before heading to Innsbruck, and about 1.5 days there again before heading back to Melbourne.

I didn't invest a lot into looking for interesting things to do. I made visits to (non-exhaustive):

* Sch&#246;nbrunn Palace, for an orchestra performance inside;
* Sacher Hotel Cafe, for the Sachertorte;
* The natural history museum (way more beautiful than any museum I've seen before);
* The Cafe Museum;
* Spittelberg; and
* Kohlmarkt

### Innsbruck

I took the train from Vienna to Innsbruck, which took about 5h. I stayed in Innsbruck only to do a multi-day hike, as it's a region in Austria known for its outdoor activities. I loosely followed the first half of the Karwendel H&#246;henweg trail.

I took the train from Innsbruck to Reith b.Seefeld Bahnhof train station, where I started the hike. The hike is pretty well-signed, so navigation is not really an issue. However, the hike requires traversing up and down steep rocky sections where the rocks are quite loose. Having appropriate hiking shoes is strongly recommended.

I used the huts for accomodation, and didn't need to book in advance. The first hut, N&#246;rdlinger H&#252;tte, was quite popular, so I would recommend booking that in advance if you're in a big group. The other huts I stayed at (in order) were Bettelwurf H&#252;tte, and Pfeis H&#252;tte.

After the first day, I had to come down from N&#246;rdlinger H&#252;tte because I didn't bring the right socks and my shoe was giving me blisters. I continued the track (kind of) and getting down to Seefeld Bahnhof, took the train back to Innsbruck, and took the cable car back and walked to Bettelwurf H&#252;tte, where I stayed for the night. The next night I stayed at Pfeis H&#252;tte and walked to Scharnitz Bahnhof to take the train back to Innsbruck.

The hike is quite challenging and quite a lot of distance is covered, so I would recommend this only if you're pretty fit and have good balance and hand-eye coordination.

### Salzburg
Salzburg is famous for being where The Sound of Music was filmed. I spent a couple nights here, where I rented a bike and rode around Salzburg (would highly recommend).
