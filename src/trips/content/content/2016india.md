This trip was part of a University subject that let you volunteer as report on your experiences. I chose to do a volunteer program with 40K Globe which lasted for a month. I spent a week either side of it travelling around.

My colleague, Maivi, and I flew into Delhi where we would rendezvous with another volunteer, Karen. We flew in shortly after a festival, where they had set fireworks off everywhere in the city. Smog galore - I couldn't even breathe properly!

We arrived at our accomodation, Jugaad Hostels, around 9:30pm. We planned on staying here for two nights. After fighting jet lag (6h time difference) and getting whatever sleep we could, we spent the morning exploring the Hauz Khas District Park, a walkable distance from our Hostel. It's pretty cool that such cool ruins would exist in the middle of a city like Delhi. I'm not sure what purpose it served in the past, but now it's a leisure area for the public and apparently a favourite makeout spot for teens.

Afterwards, we paid a visit to the Qutab Minar and the Lotus Temple, short rides by tuk tuk.

Can't say that these were spectacular times - I just recall being pretty tired from the jet leg haha!
