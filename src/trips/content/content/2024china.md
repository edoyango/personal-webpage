Like what seems to be tradition at this point, we went on another November trip this year. But this time a place closer
to home (mentally) - China.

I don't have particularly great feelings about China, despite it being my "home" country and where most of my extended 
family live. Growing up, I usually *had* to come to China when dad and mum flew over for dad's work trips and most of
the time, my siblings didn't join, so I didn't have a lot of company. So I mostly remember being bored and lonely. Also
doesn't help that my Chinese is pretty bad - maybe enough to survive, but not close to being conversational.

But this time was different! I was visiting China with Winn (my fiancé) and her family (parents and one of her little
brothers), so I had ample company. We were also visiting somewhere where I actually wanted to go - Yunnan (云南)! I knew
remember my mum mentioning that it was beautiful and she always wanted to go, and I knew that it had beautiful
snow-capped mountains that I could potentially hike. 

But most importantly, I was keen to visit my relatives on my dad's side - in part because I hadn't seen them for so
long, but also because they knew my dad for much longer than my mum did, and I was hoping to learn what he was like when
he was much younger. I also wanted to learn more about my extended family as I was mentally preparing to start my own in
the coming years.

This trip was more personal than others I've taken - I was visiting family I hadn't seen in a long time to learn about
my family history and I was also hoping that traveling with Winn and her family would change my impression of China for
the better.

But first up was Guangzhou (广州) - my partner's "hometown" and where her parents grew up and grandma still presides.

# Guangzhou (广州) pt. 1

I was told many times that Guangzhou was famous for its food selection. Gaungzhou has one of the largest domestic
immigrant population, so it has cuisine from all around China. And not only is the selection good, so is the price!
Our first breakfast consisted of 6 dishes (for 4 people) and 3 soy milks which cost around AU$15 altogher! Back home it
easily would've been 5x the price...

We spent altogether roughly 2.5 weeks in Guangzhou - most of it was spent shopping, seeing Winn's family and family
friends, and being ferried around to visit cool places. On our first day, we visited Winn's grandma - who, I was told, 
lived in a "village". Apparently since the 5 years since Winn's family had been, her village had been engulfed by the 
expanding concrete jungle that is Guanghzou.

The rest of the day was spent in full tourist mode. In Guangzhou's "Glasses city", we ordered AU$40 glasses that 
doubled as sunnies. The procedure was quick and the tech impressive, and the only challenge was choosing which of the
seemingly hundreds of glasses stores to buy from! While waiting for the glasses to be made, we visited Shamian island 
(沙面岛), where western merchants used to work and preside. It has a distinctly western style architecture (I think 
portugese) which constrasts heavily against the concrete jungle of Guangzhou surrounding it. Conveniently nearby was the 
hotel that Winn's dad had a career at before coming to Australia. So, we visited there before returning to the glasses 
city to collect the glasses we ordered in the morning.

The next day we also went to see the Guangzhou International Light Show, which featured laser light shows and a
beautifully lit up Canton tower!

# Changsha (长沙)

Changsha is where Winn and I were visiting my aunts. Neither of them live there, but it's where they and my dad grew up
together. My older aunty happened to be visiting from Shenzhen and my younger aunty happened to be in Taiwan while I was
visiting and managed to squeeze in a visit. 

The 3 days we were there was pretty packed with activities and visits, and in between, I would catch up with my aunts
who I hadn't seen for 10 or 20 years and learn about dad and grandpa and the rest of their side of the family.

Our first visit was the middle school my dad went (no. 1 middle school - 一中), where I got to meet my dad's
classmates who heard I was visiting. I learnt a lot about what dad was like at that age, the role they played in
eachother's lives, and about the circumstances that they grew up in. Dad seemed like a leader to them and their feelings
toward him seem to be that of admiration, and for some, regret - beacuse of the actions (or lacktherof) that led to his
capture and imprisonment following. This part of the trip was very eye opening because it was the first time I had heard
from people who were with him as a teenager, and who that close to the events that changes his life forever.

There were a couple more personal visits we made - first to see a family friend who worked for my grandpa and I saw
every time I visited with my family. We also met with my dad's cousins who I had apparently met when I was very young
(no recollection) and we went together to visit my grandpa's grave. From them I learnt that my dad had apparently spent
more time with their dad than his own.

But we still had plenty of chances to visit more touristy places - including Orange (as in the fruit) Isle, which had a
bizarre giant statue of young Maozedong. We also visited a cultural revolution themed tea-house (an interesting business
decision...), the old city wall, and various shopping streets (new and old). We even got a personal tour from the former
director and restoration architect for China's oldest academy - Yuelu Academy. He was also accompanied by Dr. Jordan, 
faculty of the attached Hunan University (specialising in Chinese Philosophy and originally from Tasmania), who was 
acting as my our very over-qualified translator.

# Guanghzou pt. 2

We had a few days in Guangzhou, where I planned to mostly work remotely (since I didn't have enough leave to take the entire 5 weeks
off without pay). Winn and her family saw some sights around the city, and in the evenings I would join them to eat dinner with her
dad's friends. During that time, we stayed a night in a private villa adjacent to the Lanyuan hot spring resort (兰苑温泉). Our
villa was apparently where party officials and company CEOs would often stay when visiting. It even had hot spring baths within the
rooms! Dinner was in a giant and beautifully decorated room with a giant table. As part of the package, we even got a private tour
Maozedong's holiday villa located nearby, containing beautiful art works like one that appears to change seasons based on the colour
of the light in the room!

I had to work during the day while we were there, but I tried to make the most of it!
