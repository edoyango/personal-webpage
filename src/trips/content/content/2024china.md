Like what seems to be tradition at this point, we went on another November trip this year. But this time a place closer
to home (mentally) - China.

I don't have particularly great feelings about China, despite it being my "home" country and where most of my extended 
family live. Growing up, I usually *had* to come to China when dad and mum flew over for dad's work trips and most of
the time, my siblings didn't join, so I didn't have a lot of company. So I mostly remember being bored and lonely. Also
doesn't help that my Chinese is pretty bad - maybe enough to survive, but not close to being conversational.

But this time was different! I was visiting China with Winn (my fiancé) and her family (parents and one of her little
brothers), so I had ample company. We were also visiting somewhere where I actually wanted to go - Yunnan (云南)! I knew
remember my mum mentioning that it was beautiful and she always wanted to go, and I knew that it had beautiful
snow-capped mountains that I could potentially hike. 

But most importantly, I was keen to visit my relatives on my dad's side - in part because I hadn't seen them for so
long, but also because they knew my dad for much longer than my mum did, and I was hoping to learn what he was like when
he was much younger. I also wanted to learn more about my extended family as I was mentally preparing to start my own in
the coming years.

This trip was more personal than others I've taken - I was visiting family I hadn't seen in a long time to learn about
my family history and I was also hoping that traveling with Winn and her family would change my impression of China for
the better.

But first up was Guangzhou (广州) - my partner's "hometown" and where her parents grew up and grandma still presides.

# Guangzhou (广州) pt. 1

I was told many times that Guangzhou was famous for its food selection. Gaungzhou has one of the largest domestic
immigrant population, so it has cuisine from all around China. And not only is the selection good, so is the price!
Our first breakfast consisted of 6 dishes (for 4 people) and 3 soy milks which cost around AU$15 altogher! Back home it
easily would've been 5x the price...

We spent altogether roughly 2.5 weeks in Guangzhou - most of it was spent shopping, seeing Winn's family and family
friends, and being ferried around to visit cool places. On our first day, we visited Winn's grandma - who, I was told, 
lived in a "village". Apparently since the 5 years since Winn's family had been, her village had been engulfed by the 
expanding concrete jungle that is Guanghzou.

The rest of the day was spent in full tourist mode. In Guangzhou's "Glasses city", we ordered AU$40 glasses that 
doubled as sunnies. The procedure was quick and the tech impressive, and the only challenge was choosing which of the
seemingly hundreds of glasses stores to buy from! While waiting for the glasses to be made, we visited Shamian island 
(沙面岛), where western merchants used to work and preside. It has a distinctly western style architecture (I think 
portugese) which constrasts heavily against the concrete jungle of Guangzhou surrounding it. Conveniently nearby was the 
hotel that Winn's dad had a career at before coming to Australia. So, we visited there before returning to the glasses 
city to collect the glasses we ordered in the morning.

The next day we also went to see the Guangzhou International Light Show, which featured laser light shows and a
beautifully lit up Canton tower!

# Changsha (长沙)

Changsha is where Winn and I were visiting my aunts. Neither of them live there, but it's where they and my dad grew up
together. My older aunty happened to be visiting from Shenzhen and my younger aunty happened to be in Taiwan while I was
visiting and managed to squeeze in a visit. 

The 3 days we were there was pretty packed with activities and visits, and in between, I would catch up with my aunts
who I hadn't seen for 10 or 20 years and learn about dad and grandpa and the rest of their side of the family.

Our first visit was the middle school my dad went (no. 1 middle school - 一中), where I got to meet my dad's
classmates who heard I was visiting. I learnt a lot about what dad was like at that age, the role they played in
eachother's lives, and about the circumstances that they grew up in. Dad seemed like a leader to them and their feelings
toward him seem to be that of admiration, and for some, regret - beacuse of the actions (or lacktherof) that led to his
capture and imprisonment following. This part of the trip was very eye opening because it was the first time I had heard
from people who were with him as a teenager, and who that close to the events that changes his life forever.

![Me with my dad's photo at his middle school](/trips/img/trips-china2024/Image_20241220160453_cr.jpg "gallery")

There were a couple more personal visits we made - first to see a family friend who worked for my grandpa and I saw
every time I visited with my family. We also met with my dad's cousins who I had apparently met when I was very young
(no recollection) and we went together to visit my grandpa's grave. From them I learnt that my dad had apparently spent
more time with their dad than his own.

But we still had plenty of chances to visit more touristy places - including Orange (as in the fruit) Isle, which had a
bizarre giant statue of young Maozedong. We also visited a cultural revolution themed tea-house (an interesting business
decision...), the old city wall, and various shopping streets (new and old). We even got a personal tour from the former
director and restoration architect for China's oldest academy - Yuelu Academy. He was also accompanied by Dr. Jordan, 
faculty of the attached Hunan University (specialising in Chinese Philosophy and originally from Tasmania), who was 
acting as my our very over-qualified translator.

# Guanghzou pt. 2

We had a few days in Guangzhou, where I planned to mostly work remotely (since I didn't have enough leave to take the entire 5 weeks
off without pay). Winn and her family saw some sights around the city, and in the evenings I would join them to eat dinner with her
dad's friends. During that time, we stayed a night in a private villa adjacent to the Lanyuan hot spring resort (兰苑温泉). Our
villa was apparently where party officials and company CEOs would often stay when visiting. It even had hot spring baths within the
rooms! Dinner was in a giant and beautifully decorated room with a giant table. As part of the package, we even got a private tour
Maozedong's holiday villa located nearby, containing beautiful art works like one that appears to change seasons based on the colour
of the light in the room!

I had to work during the day while we were there, but I tried to make the most of it!

# Yunnan (云南)

When Winn's dad was planning this trip, he asked for places we wanted to see. I very much wanted to visit Yunnan - known for it's
beautiful mountain ranges and culture. From that, he organised a 4-city trip: Dali (大理), Lijiang (丽江), Shangri-la (香格里拉), and Kunming (昆明), in that order. We travelled to Lijiang from Gaunghzou by high-speed rail, and even with the  "high speed", the trip 
took over 11 hours! Taking the plane was totally an option here, but the train tickets were half the price (costs add up when
travelling with 5 people), and Winn's dad and I like sitting on trains. I took the opportunity to work remotely, which was fine
given since the seating was comfortable, but my mobile internet would drop often, so I found it difficult to have meetings. The
views heading toward western china were overall very charming, and in some parts, there were jagged 100-meter hills standing amongst
the chinese villages.

![Screenshot of the journey taken from Dali, Lijiang, Shangri-La, and Kunming cities in Yunnan](/trips/img/trips-china2024/yunnan-screenshot.png)

## Yunnan - Dali (大理)

We arrived at Dali in the evening and a taxi, organised by our accomodation, took us to our accomodation. We were staying just
outside the old-city southern gate, which was beautifully lit-up as we drove past. Staying in the old town was very pleasant because
you're already quite close to most of the popular tourist destinations, and you get more time to enjoy the traditional style
architecture. The buildings in the old town have apparently been there for ages, and it used to be a poor area of Dali. But they
restored all the buildings to attract tourists.

Dali is probably most famous for the lake - Erhai (洱海) AKA Er Sea, apparently because they're nowhere near the ocean, so this is
their beach holiday destination. We know that many tourists, when they come here, like to rent an electric motorobike to ride around
the lake and stop at the sights, but we weren't brave enough to risk it. Instead, we got one of the drivers to take us around to the
sights we chose. This only really works if you can speak chinese as not many of the drivers can speak English, and they'll charge 
you a fair bit more, if they notice you're western. Acting as Gaungzhou tourists, we paid roughly 300 RMB for a day with a
7-seater and a driver.

My favourite places to visit were the Old Town and the Three Pagodas. The old town is fairly touristy, but still with many stores
selling local specialties like silver, jade, rocks/minerals, flower teas, coffee, wine, and the list goes on! Some of the stores
even have live alpacas hanging around *I think* for good Feng Shui, but they definitely double as a marketing tool. We wandered 
around the old town twice - once during the day and once at night. During the day, some of the streets will have open air markets
selling fruit and other local snacks, and during the night, they light up the street with paper lanterns and all the many
colourfully dressed performers appear, dancing from the balconies.

The three pagodas exist as a buddhist monument and apparently has a multi-millenia history. Its age is impressive and appearance
unique and well-maintained, as it has been restored many times. Now, while the name (and many of the photos), suggest that the
pagodas are the main attraction. And they are indeed very striking, but I enjoyed the visit moreso because of the surrounding park 
and buddhist temples that are behind the pagodas. There are multiple that you can walk up through each of the temples have their own
description to read and learn from. The final temple is the Chongsheng temple (崇圣寺), which ends up being quite a hike to get up
to. But, you're rewarded with a gorgeous view of Erhai and the surrounds.

Some of the foods that we tried in Dali that I liked are the mushroom hotpot, rice noodles (米线), the Dali yoghurts, and the tea
and flower flavoured wines. These are all easy to find in the touristy areas, but they're generally cheaper in the city.

The city also has some things exploring - we wandered around Erhai park (which is apparently where dragons come to rest), which has
some beautiful spots where couples get professional photos taken! There's also a small zoo attached, but I would avoid that as the
animals don't look well taken care of (there is a couple very adorable red pandas though). The Bai museum (Bai is an ethnic minority
in Dali) was also an interesting visit. It motivated me to buy Dali shi (shi is stone) AKA marble that Dali households often
display like art, although in the end I never got a piece.

## Lijiang (丽江)

After an already enjoyable Lijiang trip, we took a couple hours high-speed train ride further west to Lijiang. From Dali, lijiang is
an additional 400m above sea level. We definitely started to feel the effects of elevation if we tried to exert ourselves. This 
time, we were staying IN the old town, in a repurposed old building which had 5 rooms being used for holidayers like us. The old 
town appeared to be popular for couples and influencers to get dressed up and take photos around town (our accomodation was near a 
few of such of the popular spots). The evenings are the busiest time as the town is very lit with colourful lights and the central 
square has some of the older locals facilitating a dance circle while they play loud hybrid of tibetan folk music and edm. All the 
stores sell similar things to what we saw in the old town in Dali, but there seemed to be a larger selection of food. We tried to
find a bar to hang out at, but the prices for drinks were pretty steep, so we opted to buy drinks at a convenience store and drink
in our AirBnB.

The nearby Heilongtan park (黑龙潭公园) is a pleasant change of scenery from the hustle and bustle of old town as it has a
combination of temples and nature to look at. There was also a hike that gives a good view of Jade Dragon Snowy Mountain (玉龙雪山) 
the tallest mountain in the city. We did half of the hike as I was sick and Winn's dad wasn't feeling great because of the elevation 
of Lijiang, but it's a pleasant walk if you don't mind a 1h or-so round trip (it does have lots of steps though). Heilongtan park 
also had a lot of birds around which I enjoyed. We also saw wild squirrels being fed by some of the locals!

The highlight of Lijiang was the visit to Jade Dragon Mountain. The peak of the mountain is almost at 5,600m but you can get to
4,600ish by cablecar, and walk up 200m to get to a viewing platform for the peak. Note that to get a cablecar ticket, you have to
but the ticket the day before. The website makes tickets available at 8pm everyday for the next day, but they disappear quickly,
so you have to be fast! It was also not obvious how to book the tickets - we visited the tourist office in the old town, and they
gave us a wechat link to use. The cablecar starts from the visitor center. 

Before going to the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain visitor centre, if you're doubtful as to whether you can handle the elevation, buy
your oxygen cylinders *before* going, as they're much cheaper in the old town. You'll probably want 1-2 per person. You can get to 
the visitor centre by public bus, which is much cheaper than tours or hiring a driver (it cost us around 20 RMB, but I don't 
remember the exact number). Note that the visitor centre elevation is already quite high - around 3200m. For us, the wait to *get 
onto the cablecar* took over half an hour as the attraction is *that* popular. The cablecar ride itself is only about 10mins and 
views are already impressive.

At the top, you're welcomed by a huge crowd of people taking photos and lining up to take photos with the 4600m elevation sign. Now
is a good time to start using your oxygen cylinder. You can walk up the wooden stairway another 200-ish metres to get to the viewing
platform that sits at roughly 4800m elevation. On a good day, the viewing platform should have visibility of the peak, but the view
was obscured by clouds when we went. Apparently spring/summer offers better visibility. Waiting for the cablecar going down took
longer than going up (maybe 45-60mins?), so be prepared to stand for awhile! 

Coming down from the viewing platform, Winn and her little brother didn't feel any altitude sickness symptoms, but I had a headache
for the rest of the day. I think this was mainly because I was already sick, but I also went up to the viewing platform, exerting
myself harder by doing so. Note that we only bought 1 oxygen cylinder to share between us.

After heading back to the visitor center, you can visit Blue Moon Lake (蓝月湖) and the Yak Meadow. If you bought a ticket, the bus
ride to these places are included. Otherwise, you have to buy a ticket (I think it was around 20 RMB). Blue Moon Lake offers a
turquoise-tinted lake with full view of the Jade Dragon Mountain, so is a very popular spot for photos - we even saw a couple take
wedding shots there!

I'm a little disappointed that my first time at above 4000m was by cablecar instead of hiking, but going up Jade Long Snowy Mountain
was definitely the highlight of Yunnan for me! Although I did learn that a couple decades ago, the only way to get up was to hike
up, and one of Winn's Dad's friend's wife did that!

## Shangri-La (香格里拉)

Shangri-La is the destination furthest west in our journey. It took us another couple hours by high-speed train from Lijiang.
Shangri-la was renamed from Zhongdian (中甸县) in an effort to boost tourism (which apparently worked!). This city was the distinct 
of the places we went to on this trip - the people mostly weren't han people, the architecture style differed significantly, and it 
was also the most rural. From the train, we could see wooly cows wandering some of the streets! That being said, the city felt the
most interesting and I would even say that I enjoyed it the most. But it was also the coldest! Make sure to pack warm clothes if you
visit.

We arrived in the early afternoon, but we took it pretty easy at first - we were all feeling symptoms of altitude sickness. The city 
is located around 3150m above sea level and we all had headaches and were finding ourselves out-of-breath just walking up and down 
the hilly streets of the old town we were staying in. For dinner, we enjoyed the yak hotpot set that we enjoyed with Shangri-la beer 
and baijiu. A lot of the food here seemed to center around yak products - besides the meat itself we also got a tea, which used yak 
fat for creaminess.

In addition to the tasty hot pot, another reason the evenings in Shangri-la were fun was due to the dancing in the main square. Like
in Lijiang, every night around 7pm, there would be dance circle that dances to folk-edm. A quick google told me that it's called
"Guozhuang" dancing (锅庄舞), and is a tibetan style of group dancing. Unlike in Lijiang, the dancers had a higher ratio of locals to
tourists, and they're mostly local workers e.g. shopkeepers who dance everynight for fun and they learn by mimicking the other
dancers. But of course, tourists are welcome and the regulars appear to be very used to dancing their way around fumbling newbies.

The next day, inspired by the many chinese tourists getting dressed up, and the prevelance of the rental stores in Shangri-la, we
made the leap and got dressed up. I think for each person, an outfit cost about 60 RMB and the girls also get their hair and makeup
done for a bit extra. Winn and I got matching outfits and Winn's little brother got dressed up as well. We wandered around the
nearby temples and shrines in these outfits and snapped a few pics. You can get photographers as well, but it's a fairbit more
expensive. 

Our second day was jam-packed with sightseeing. We started off by visiting Potatso national park (普达措国家公园) which had
beautiful lakes and meadows and an abundance of birds, cows, horses, and squirrels! When you pay for the (very expensive by Chinese
standard) entry ticket, you're also paying for information from the local tour guides and bus rides to the main spots within the
national park. The tour guides told us about the local ethnic minorities and how they made their living, and their religion and
culture. But note that none of the tour guides speak English and the information signs that do have English are mostly poorly 
translated. Thankfully I had Winn to translate! 

In the afternoon, we got the driver to take us to Sumtsenling Monastery (松赞林寺). But, because of construction happening on the
roads, we had to walk a few kilometres, dodging actively working excavators (people would be fired for this safety transgression in
Aus), and past a beautiful lake seemingly overrun by cormorants, geese, and coots. But the view of the monastery from the lake was
well worth it. The monastery itself was well-maintained and looked like it was still used, and it was filled with dressed-up
tourists taking photos. But definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.
