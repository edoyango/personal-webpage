What better way to celebrate the conclusion of my partner's first year of her master's degree than to relax in Thailand!
Unlike our last trip, this would be three weeks instead of one, giving us a lot more time to *relax* and see more during
the trip.

Same as last time, we flew in and out of Bangkok, but visited Chiang Mai in addition to Phuket in between.

We managed to get $250 return flights this time, but with the addition of 70,000 Qantas Frequent Flyer points
spend.

### Bangkok (arrival)

We got one less day in Bangkok than planned, because of the 1.5 day delay of our flight (thanks Jet Star...). Accounting
for the delay, we had a whopping 24h in Bangkok before catching the overnight train to Chiang Mai.

We arrived at around 10pm Bangkok time picked up our [online preordered sim cards](https://www.klook.com/en-AU/activity/16587-dtac-4g-sim-thailand/?spm=BookingDetail.ActivityCard&clickId=a31828157b) from the Klook kiosk at the aiport and
went straight to our accomodation. Our accomodation was an [AirBnB place](https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/35329051) that
we chose mainly because it was cheap and on the airport rail line (i.e., easy to get to after our flight). It was basic,
but comfortable. And honestly, after a 9h flight and wrestling with the Bangkok heat and humidity, anywhere with a bed
and aircon was plenty. We finished the day with a visit to 7-eleven for water, and dinner via Food Panda delivery
(costing us $7.30 AUD for two meals and two drinks, including delivery!).

The next day we had three goals for the day before catching our train. Most critically, we needed to exchange our AUD
for THB. The other two less-critical tasks were to get a massage and try out a Michelin Bib-gourmand place located. Our
chosen cash exchange place was a [Super Rich store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/x8NDw6WGhKGZ9zgm6) near the Central WOrld 
shopping centre. Apparently it has consistently close to market exchange rates. Going to Central WOrld for us was super
convenient because we could take the bus, which was only 10 THB (~ 0.40 AUD) for each of us (a fraction of metro/ride 
share).

After ticking off the money exchange item, we walked around the corner to [Panda Spa and Massage](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UvbqhxkW4rAx3RbG7)
to get a back, neck, and shoulder massage to heal us from last night's long plane ride. The masseuses were super strong
and really targetted the knots in our muscles! Although my partner woke up the next morning with bruses (and a 
knot-free back). And to fuel up, we again walked around the corner to our Bib Gourmand choice: [Kuang Heng Pratu Nam
Chicken Rice](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UeEnub1e7uVwZCiL9), which, you guessed it, specialises in hainanese chicken rice.
I probably wouldn't recommend going out your way to visit, but the flavours are definitely tasty and unique, and
despite its looks, more than just a hole-in-the-wall chicken rice shop. Definitely worth visiting if you're in the area.

We made a short visit to The Market Bangkok, to escape the heat and get cold drinks, and subsequently spent the rest of 
the afternoon exploring Central WOrld. Central WOrld seemed to be marketed to tourists and/or well-off Thai people, with
a lot of well-known western brand stores. Food on the top level also has a wide selection of local Thai food and
international cuisine (the latter being much more expensive). We were super excited to find that a Studio Ghibli 
exhibition that we thought we had missed, had actually been extended into the new year! Because we needed to catch our
train to Chiang Mai, we decided to do it when we're back in Bangkok toward the end of the trip.

### Bangkok to Chiang Mai via Overnight Train

Overnight trains are definitely not the fastest option as plains between Bangkok and Chiang Mai take around a couple 
hours or so, and perhaps not the cheapest as busses as cheaper. Another criticism that I've heard is that overnight
trains can often be delayed or cancelled, although that wasn't an issue for us. But I insisted on this because this 
holiday was supposed to be relaxing, and there's something about watching the scenery pass by on a train that I find 
relaxing. 

We took the no. 9 train, which was the most comfortable overnight train at the time. There were faster trains available
but those meant arriving at 4am in the morning - not particularly convenient. Our train departed at 6:40pm with
expected arrival at 7:15am. We had a Thai friend help us book online, and we booked the second class option. Second
class consisted of booths with two chairs facing each other. And each of these booths could be turned into bunk beds.
The lower bunk gets the window (great if you're an early riser), whereas the top bunk doesn't. Power points are
available in both the seated and bunk beds configuration. **Important tip**: remember to bring an eye mask - lights are
kept on throughout the night. Ear plugs help too - We had issues with people talking in the middle of the night. We also
found the food on the train to be *relatively* expensive, so we brought our own food.

Next time, if I were to take the train again, I'd consider booking at the ticket office rather than online. Apparently
the ticket office and online bookings have seperate pools of tickets (not sure why). When we booked online, we got the
last 2 of 3 tickets which were only top bunks. But, last minute travellers who booked at the office got bottom bunks.
Additionally, if travelling in two's, I might go in first class, which lets you share a cabin (still a bunk bed) with
two people, avoiding the noise and light issue, and at least one of you gets the window.
