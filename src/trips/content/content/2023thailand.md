What better way to celebrate the conclusion of my partner's first year of her master's degree than to relax in Thailand!
Unlike our last trip, this would be three weeks instead of one, giving us a lot more time to *relax* and see more during
the trip.

Same as last time, we flew in and out of Bangkok, but visited Chiang Mai in addition to Phuket in between.

I've also included my reading list for this trip (at the bottom).

We managed to get $250 return flights this time, but with the addition of 70,000 Qantas Frequent Flyer points
spend.

### Bangkok (arrival)

We got one less day in Bangkok than planned, because of the 1.5 day delay of our flight (thanks Jet Star...). Accounting
for the delay, we had a whopping 24h in Bangkok before catching the overnight train to Chiang Mai.

We arrived at around 10pm Bangkok time picked up our [online preordered sim cards](https://www.klook.com/en-AU/activity/16587-dtac-4g-sim-thailand/?spm=BookingDetail.ActivityCard&clickId=a31828157b) from the Klook kiosk at the aiport and
went straight to our accomodation. Our accomodation was an [AirBnB place](https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/35329051) that
we chose mainly because it was cheap and on the airport rail line (i.e., easy to get to after our flight). It was basic,
but comfortable. And honestly, after a 9h flight and wrestling with the Bangkok heat and humidity, anywhere with a bed
and aircon was plenty. We finished the day with a visit to 7-eleven for water, and dinner via Food Panda delivery
(costing us $7.30 AUD for two meals and two drinks, including delivery!).

The next day we had three goals for the day before catching our train. Most critically, we needed to exchange our AUD
for THB. The other two less-critical tasks were to get a massage and try out a Michelin Bib-gourmand place located. Our
chosen cash exchange place was a [Super Rich store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/x8NDw6WGhKGZ9zgm6) near the Central WOrld 
shopping centre. Apparently it has consistently close to market exchange rates. Going to Central WOrld for us was super
convenient because we could take the bus, which was only 10 THB (~ 0.40 AUD) for each of us (a fraction of metro/ride 
share).

After ticking off the money exchange item, we walked around the corner to [Panda Spa and Massage](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UvbqhxkW4rAx3RbG7)
to get a back, neck, and shoulder massage to heal us from last night's long plane ride. The masseuses were super strong
and really targetted the knots in our muscles! Although my partner woke up the next morning with bruses (and a 
knot-free back). And to fuel up, we again walked around the corner to our Bib Gourmand choice: [Kuang Heng Pratu Nam
Chicken Rice](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UeEnub1e7uVwZCiL9), which, you guessed it, specialises in hainanese chicken rice.
I probably wouldn't recommend going out your way to visit, but the flavours are definitely tasty and unique, and
despite its looks, more than just a hole-in-the-wall chicken rice shop. Definitely worth visiting if you're in the area.

We made a short visit to The Market Bangkok, to escape the heat and get cold drinks, and subsequently spent the rest of 
the afternoon exploring Central WOrld. Central WOrld seemed to be marketed to tourists and/or well-off Thai people, with
a lot of well-known western brand stores. Food on the top level also has a wide selection of local Thai food and
international cuisine (the latter being much more expensive). We were super excited to find that a Studio Ghibli 
exhibition that we thought we had missed, had actually been extended into the new year! Because we needed to catch our
train to Chiang Mai, we decided to do it when we're back in Bangkok toward the end of the trip.

### Bangkok to Chiang Mai via Overnight Train

Overnight trains are definitely not the fastest option as plains between Bangkok and Chiang Mai take around a couple 
hours or so, and perhaps not the cheapest as busses as cheaper. Another criticism that I've heard is that overnight
trains can often be delayed or cancelled, although that wasn't an issue for us. But I insisted on this because this 
holiday was supposed to be relaxing, and there's something about watching the scenery pass by on a train that I find 
relaxing. 

We took the no. 9 train, which was the most comfortable overnight train at the time. There were faster trains available
but those meant arriving at 4am in the morning - not particularly convenient. Our train departed at 6:40pm with
expected arrival at 7:15am. We had a Thai friend help us book online, and we booked the second class option. Second
class consisted of booths with two chairs facing each other. And each of these booths could be turned into bunk beds.
The lower bunk gets the window (great if you're an early riser), whereas the top bunk doesn't. Power points are
available in both the seated and bunk beds configuration. **Important tip**: remember to bring an eye mask - lights are
kept on throughout the night. Ear plugs help too - We had issues with people talking in the middle of the night. We also
found the food on the train to be *relatively* expensive, so we brought our own food.

Next time, if I were to take the train again, I'd consider booking at the ticket office rather than online. Apparently
the ticket office and online bookings have seperate pools of tickets (not sure why). When we booked online, we got the
last 2 of 3 tickets which were only top bunks. But, last minute travellers who booked at the office got bottom bunks.
Additionally, if travelling in two's, I might go in first class, which lets you share a cabin (still a bunk bed) with
two people, avoiding the noise and light issue, and at least one of you gets the window.

### My Reading list (in order of completion)

1. Career and Family by Claudia Goldin

I first encountered Prof. Claudia's work in my undergraduate days when I heard about the stat that "women make 83 cents
for every dollar earnt by a man". I decided to revisit her ideas by reading this book because she had won this year's 
Nobel Prize in Economics.

This book, using ample primary evidence, lays out how the narratives for college-educated women changes over the past
century, when it comes to choosing career and/or having children. She starts with "group 1", who could only chose career
OR having children, explicitly through legislation like ["Marriage bars"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_bar).
After removing explicit barriers, introduction of viable female-controlled contraceptive devices and technology that 
reduces household labour, and increased demand for labour (e.g., during WW2 when men went off to war), women eventually
make their way to the present day group (group 5) who can choose to have career AND children. 

She argues that the current gender gap is *mostly*, but not *entirely*, driven by the fact that high-paying jobs tend
to be "greedy jobs" and it is impossible to have a greedy job and be a primary caretaker at the same time. Greedy jobs
apparently result in higher pay both because of the more hours worked, but also these jobs are payed *more per hour*
because workers are effectively on-call, hours are inconsistent, and more time in the profession tends to be rewarded by
clients. The examples of high paying greedy jobs Prof. Claudia uses are doctors, lawyers, consultants, and investment
bankers. She argues that bias against women is unlikely to be a *large* factor for the pay gap because her data shows 
that women who are not a primary caretaker (e.g., women without children, or the breadwinner in a same-sex
marriage/parentship) earn only a bit less than what men do.

Towards the end of the book, she highlights changes currently happening and further changes needed to reduce the cost of
dropping out of these traditionally greedy jobs:
* Consulting firms are finding that early-career women are leaving to become caretakers, which is unecomical for the firms due to brain drain and wasted training, and so are raising the "substitutability" of workers and introducing work-life-balance measures, which Prof. Claudia argues is critical to keeping women working in well-paid careers.
* Having workers on call isn't strictly necessary, and changes in the system can reduce the need for workers to be on-call. For example: vets used to be small-businesses only and owners would be on call, and eventually they moved to small-businesses would be 9-5, but a centralised facility would be available 24/7 for emergencies, which would have vets on a roster, so nobody would have to be on call (also similar to how GPs work with emergency departments). 
* Lower the cost of child care, so the primary caretaking partner (usually the wife in heterosexual couples) doesn't need to take time off.
* alter societal norms, so it isn't always the woman being the primary caretaker.

I liked this book as it gave a lot more clarity to gender economic inequity. Popular discourse tends to be lazy in how
they discuss it by attributing the inequity to abstract and not measurable concepts like "the patriarchy", "sexism"; and
instead it writes a narrative based on primary data for what has happened and what is happening. I'm not saying that we
don't live in a patriarchical society that can enforce gender norms, or that there isn't sex bias in our society, but
that by providing a mechanism to phenomena like the gender pay gap, provide a far more useful way to discuss it, as well
as address it. I think that Prof. Claudia provides a very clear and easy to understand view of the gender pay gap, and
provides some guidance on how it can be addressed. I also appreciate that later in the book, she treats the issues as
arising from couples' situations and decisions (rather than attributing the issue to the patriarchy or sexism in a
hand-wavy manner), as well as acknowledging that men generally prefer being present as fathers and lament when they are
not. Finally, I think the comments and solution towards the end provide good guidance for which policies to promote if 
we want live (and work) in a world where both parents have the opportunity to take care of their kids, without losing long-term income. 

Overall, a good and intuitive, albeit dense read. A must read for anyone seeking specificity and clarity on the gender
pay gap, and the strides women have made and the challenges they still face.

2. Of Boys and Men by Richard Reeves

I found this book on [The Economist Reads](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/12/06/these-are-the-economists-best-books-of-2022) as they recommended it as one of their best books to read from 2022. At
first, I just wanted to make sure I had a look at issues facing men (especially since I'm a man), but it turned out to
be a much needed read, after reading Claudia Goldin's book, to remind myself that men also have a story to tell.

Dr. Richard Reeves uses a combination of primary data, secondary data, and others' writings to highlight issues facing
modern men and boys. In addition to describing issues, he also makes an effort to be apolitical, but does indeed address 
the differences in the more *extreme* left and right wing views (US) surrounding gender issues. He tries to carefully
highlight that while women do indeed experience challenges, men's outcomes in very recent history, are worsening for a
variety of reasons. He occasionally criticizes the state of public discourse and policy around gender issues to be 
biased in the favour of women as efforts to address mens issues are assumed to be detracting from women's or LGBTIQA+ 
issues, and instead argues that "we can hold two thoughts at once" and "it isn't a zero-sum game".

The main issues that I see him identifying throughout the book are:

* Biological sex differences in childhood and adolescences leads to learning differences in boys and girls (current schooling timelines apparently suit girls better than boys). Women have also overtaken men by a wide margin in college enrolment and completion (and men who do complete take longer, on average).
* Agender policies (e.g., policies that waive college fees for everyone) unintentionally benefit women much more than men
* Work that men have traditionally gone into (often manual labour) are currently being automated and many men are not re-entering the work force
* Gender roles assigned to men have yet to move on from men being economic providers - problematic in a world where women can provide for themselves, and in a world where traditionally male jobs are disappearing (see above)
* Gender expectation prevent males from being retrenched into HEAL (Health, Education, Administration, Literacy) jobs, despite evidence to suggest that having male teachers (for example), could improve outcomes for boys in schools.

Dr. Richard suggests that these issues can be solved in tandem, and often result in win-win-win situations (win for men,
win for their partners and/or children, and win for society writ large). The clearest example being getting men into
HEAL jobs removing the stereotype that men cannot be carers. This would provide more jobs for men; make it socially
acceptable for men to be more involved in child care and reduce the expecation on women to be primary child carers; help
boys in schools (boys apparently benefit from having male teachers, and girls' outcomes aren't affected); and society
benefit by filling jobs in a sector that has huge job growth (apparently 3 HEAL jobs are created for every STEM job).

A couple solutions that he proposes seem actionable, in that they are simple to implement (adminstratively), but may
require a bit of persuasion. For example, he proposes that we "redshirt" boys i.e., have all of them start school a year 
later due to boys' cognitive development being delayed in childhood and adolescence compared to girls. This is already
being done on an ad-hoc basis, especially in affluent schools. Furthermore, there is ample evidence supporting this
policy. When talking about getting men into HEAL jobs, Dr. Reeves suggests that policy-makers should mimic initiatives
used by campaigns to get girls into STEM jobs - such as, getting speakers at school to raise awareness of men in
HEAL, introduce summer programs, and introducing quotas in HEAL - similar to those implemented for women in STEM. But
he seems to draw short in identifying actionable solutions for resolving gender issues. It seems that women (according
to Claudia Goldin's narrative), needed barriers removed to progress in closing the gap, but data used in this book 
suggests that men are also facing identity and motivation issues.

I liked this book a lot for multiple reasons. Firstly, it echoed, validated, and explained things that I noticed in high 
school and uni - like how girls were more switched on and motivated than me and most other males I knew. I respect how
hard the author tries to avoid presenting boy/men's issues as being in competition with girl/women's issues. And I
appreciate how he highlights that particularly lower class men's incomes are decreasing, whereas this isn't the case for
same-classed women. Or you could frame it as "men's problems are that those at the bottom are becoming worse off,
whereas women's problems are that it is almost impossible to get in the top". Most importantly, I feel like the book
does a lot to give voice to issues affecting large swathes of men, like the change in gender roles, and the loss of 
income. It highlights the discrepency in how men's issues are treated - men's issues are ignored (evident by lack of
government and non-profit entities campaigning for men's issues), and women's issues are apparently caused by men. And
finally, it shows that men have a lot of gaps to close with women too - like in education, mental health, and identity.

I found this book easier to read than Prof. Claudia's, probably owing to the fact that Claudia has always been
an academic, that Dr. Reeve typically writes in non-academic spaces, but also because the issues highlighted in the book
resonate a bit more with me (being a male). I found this book very personally meaningful, but generally interesting
because it highlights issues facing men that I wasn't aware of. It was also useful to get a bit of an insight for how
men experiencing these issues could be drawn into and taken advantage of by right wing and online toxic communities.

3. Sightseeing by Rattawut Lapcharoensap

I chose to read this book because I wanted to read a book about Thailand without being about tourism. It was also my
fiction/easy read break in between reading the above two books. Importantly, this book was written by a Thai person
(US born, Bangkok raised), which was special because all other English books I could find were written by westerners and
paid a lot of attention to Bangkok's sex trade for some reason.

The book has 6 short stories and a novella - all based in Thailand, and mostly from the perspective of a Thai person.
But the settings were different each time, offering different slices of life in different places, at different times.

Most of these stories were quite perplexing to me - not because of their somber tone, but because of how tragic the
characters' circumstances are. They're mostly low socio-economic status and their environment is just so different from
the one I grew up in - in the stories financial insecurity was pervasive, single parenthood was in a couple, early
sexualisation and harrassment, racism, and the list goes on. But each of the stories, these adversities are viewed
through a lense of naivete - which made me wonder: how common are these issues in Thailand really?

But I thought the books were interesting for another reason - they portray viewpoints from different "kinds" of Thai
people. In the first story, Farang, the show how local Thai people living on a tourist island view the western tourists, 
which, in the story, is with infatuation (the protagonist's feelings), or with hesitation and resentment (some of the
other local's feelings). In the last story (the novella), more interactions between characters in a town are fleshed
out, highlighting the complex dynamic in a small town with limited opportunity and law enforcement.

Overall, as a fan of somber slice of life's, I really enjoyed the book. I'm not sure how common stories like the ones
told in the book are (although ChatGPT4 tells me it's very authentic to Thai's experience), but I would recommend it for
anyone looking to experience Thailand from a more local and realistic lense.
