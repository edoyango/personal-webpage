			<h1>Dec 2020 Wilson's Promontory &#127475;&#127487;</h1>
			<p>What better way to celebrate the easing of COVID lockdown measures than to go out for a long hike in Victoria's beautiful Wilson's Prom?</p>
            <p>I invited my research teammate, and my girlfriend's brother, Tim, along for the 3-day hike on Wilson's Prom's eastern circuit. </p>

			<h2>Milford Track</h2>
			<p>We were due to start the Milford track the day after we arrived, so after arriving into Queenstown, we picked up our rental (got a free upgrade to an SUV), and drove straight to Te Anau. This took a couple hours.</p>
			<p>In Te Anau, we made sure we had enough food for the coming 3 day, 2 night hike. We also had the time to visit the nearby animal sanctuary.</p>
			<p>The hike itself was amazing. It starts off with a boat ride from Te Anau Downs, which takes you to the actual hike. The hike takes you through the Fiordland National Park - almost devoid of human activity. They strongly emphasise the conservational efforts and direct you to avoid straying from the track and leaving rubbish.</p>
			<p>The first day is very short and quite easy, so a very good ease into the next day, where you ascend to the peak before ascending a little to reach the second hut. The Last day is spent descending a bit and walking on flat terrain, before being taken to Milford Sound by boat.</p>
			<p>The scenery is gorgeous, with views from up high, crystal clear water, and pretty friendly birds hungry for snacks. The non-commercial huts are pretty well maintained and comfortable and the guides who stay there are very knowledgable!</p>
			<p>I would strongly recommend this for anyone up for a bit of a challenge. Ample hiking experience probably isn't necessary - the walk lengths aren't ridiculous and you have plenty of time to take breaks and enjoy the scenery. Just hope the weather is good!</p>
