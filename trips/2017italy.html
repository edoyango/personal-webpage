		<h1>Jul 2017 North Italy &#127470;&#127481;</h1>
		<p>I spent just under a month in Italy - two weeks for an Australian winter (Italian summer) University subject; and the rest for travelling around.

		<h2>ROME</h2>
		<p>The ruins in Rome are amazing, and the Vatican City is beautiful, but as the old saying goes, Rome doesn't need more than a day. I toured with a girl from Yale (going to Yale being the first thing she revealed about herself), and a guy I bumped to on the plane who happened to go to my Highschool!</p>

		<h2>Florence</h2>
		<p>Florence was located only a 30min train ride from Prato, where I would be attending classes. Prato is a small city outside of Florence with few tourist attractions, whereas Florence is a tourist hot spot with beautiful architecture and nice stores. Staying in Florence sounded like a good idea while planning, but living in a tourist hotspot wore off after a few days...</p>
