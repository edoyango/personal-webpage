			<h1>Oct 2022 Thailand &#127462;&#127482;</h1>
			<p>My partner, Winn, booked this flight during a massive sale and at a time when Thailand's border entry still had some restrictions due to COVID. But, it only cost us 250 AUD return (that's right, $250 for there and back!) for each of us. The bet paid off and Thailand lifted all restrictions and we were free to enjoy our super cheap holiday in Thailand! This trip was a short one - only 7 nights, so we had to make the most of the time we were there! Winn was a champion and organised most, if not all, of the schedule.</p>

			<p>Is it really a trip to Thailand if you haven't been to Phuket? Our tight schedule gave us 3 nights (2 full days) to enjoy the fine white sand beaches with turquoise clear waters.</p>
			<p>After our two hour flight from Bangkok to Phuket, we took another two hour bus ride to our hotel - The Sea Galleri. The hotel was located on a hill side that commanded gorgeous views of the sea - welcoming us into the "relax" part of our trip.</p>
			<p>The breakfasts at the hotel, not because of the food (although it was good), but because it was by the pool side and also on the hotel rooftop, thus also giving wonderful views you could enjoy while you swam and ate. Really awesome way to start the day, and of course we went for plenty of dips. If we wanted a change of scenery, we could go down to the pool by the reception too! Even more, Kata beach and Kata Noi Beach is a very short shuttle bus ride down the hill.</p>
			<p>We spent most of our first full day wondering Phuket Old Town - about half an hour tuk tuk ride from Kata Beach. Roads in near the town center like Thalang, Phang Nga, and Dibuk Roads are full of old and colourful portuguese-style buildings apparently owing to the tin mining industry that used to exist in the area. It was low 30-degrees C when we went, so walking around alone was pretty sapping. Our massage at Sansabai Massage 2 was great not just because of the awesome deep tissue massages we got, but also because of the relief of a cold shower to rinse off with. Torry's Ice Cream was also a welcome treat to help keep cool, although it is very expensive by Thai standards. In total, we spent around 4h in Phuket Old Town.</p>
			<p>Our second day was allocated to a scuba diving cruise to Phi Phi islands and a couple other nearby islands. We went with Seastar who were very professional and also pretty popular. We made 3 stops for scuba diving, and 2 more for on-land sight-seeing and lunch. The waters were so clear and beautiful, and the sea-life plenty &#128031;. At one of the scuba stops, we were so surprised to see all the fish and that they were pretty indifferent to people. If you stay a little still for a bit, they would swim around you like you were another rock on the seabed! Winn unfortunately got seasick, so she was having a pretty bad time as the day went on, and as we discovered a couple days later - she was also pretty sick too &#128567;</p>
			<p>It's such a shame we only had a few nights at Phuket - I would've loved to spend a few more days lounging by the beach or swimming more in the waters.</p>
