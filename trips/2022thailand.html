			<h1>Oct 2022 Thailand &#127462;&#127482;</h1>
			<p>My partner, Winn, booked this flight during a massive sale and at a time when Thailand's border entry still had some restrictions due to COVID. But, it only cost us 250 AUD return (that's right, $250 for there and back!) for each of us. The bet paid off and Thailand lifted all restrictions and we were free to enjoy our super cheap holiday in Thailand! This trip was a short one - only 7 nights, so we had to make the most of the time we were there! Winn was a champion and organised most, if not all, of the schedule.</p>

			<h2 id="bangkok">Bangkok</h2>
			<p>In Bangkok, we stayed near Asok station in Sukhumvit - an area pretty well known for its night life. For most of our time in Bangkok, we stayed in a relatively <a href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/53240476">affordable place</a> near Korea Town. Our last night in Bangkok, after Phuket, was a short walk away in <a href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/556001634880714775">another AirBnB</a>.</p>
			<p>October can be a pretty hot and humid time of year for Thailand, and Bangkok was especially bad thanks to all the urbanisation. Thankfully, our accomodation was located a few hundred metres away from Terminal 21, a huge shopping mall with heaps of stores and, most importantly, super tasty and cheap Thai street food. But of course, they've also got other cuisines if you want to try something a little different - Japanese food is plentiful here too!</p>
			<p>While we were in Bangkok, we managed to get a massage every day, costing between 8 and 16 AUD, depending on the duration and type of massage. Places we visited (all in the Sukhumvit area), from most-to-least favourite:</p>

				<li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Ntc8kQBSthX8K4NQA">Sharon Thai Massage</a></li>
			</ol>
			<p>We spent a lot of time at Chatuchak and Jodd Fairs outdoor markets, buying "elephant pants" and enjoying the street food they had to offer. We even tried some weed brownies at Jodd Fairs (my first weed experience &#127807;).</p>
			<p>Yaowarat is also a great outdoor street food market to visit. Super crowded at dinner time and pretty long waits in line, but totally worth it. The stalls are regularly written about on the <a href="https://guide.michelin.com/th/en/article/dining-out/five-incredible-street-food-stalls-in-yaowarat-s-chinatown">Michelin Guide</a>, and there are a couple stalls even have stars! But brace yourself for the crowds &#128517;.</p>
			<p>We made quite a few visits to malls as well: Terminal 21 (multiple visits since it was nearby and food was so good and cheap), Siam Square (a bit ordinary), and Icon Siam.</p>
			<p>Icon Siam is especially spectacular! Don't let the luxury brands turn you off - inside is a pseudo street food market that has a great selection of very affordable street food options. They even have mini canals to replicate the floating markets that Bangkok is also known for. There are also stalls selling cute accessories and handmade leather goods which. The mall also has a food court on one of the top floors with a controlled rainfall water feature, light fixtures, and awesome views of the city. I would strongly recommend a visit to Icon Siam to enjoy the food and marvel at the luxury.</p>
			<p>And if all that wasn't enough, outside of Icon Siam, you can hop on a boat for a river cruise with dinner buffet and live music, which passes temples that are lit up in the night. There are a few providers, but we went with <a href="https://chaophrayacruise.com/en/">Chao Phraya Princess Cruises</a>, which is bookable in advance on their website or on Klook. For us, Klook indicated it was fully booked, but we managed to get tickets by going to their ticket desk inside Icon Siam.</p>
			<p>A highlight of our stay in Bangkok was the day tour to Ayutthaya (pronounced like a-yoo-ta-ya, which an emphasis on yoo). Winn booked this tour via Klook. We were picked up at Sheraton Grande Sukhumvit at the early hours of 6:20 (to avoid the heat and tourist peak traffic) and we were done by about 2:30pm. Unfortunatley for us, the weather had done us dirty with almost 40 degree C temperatures and 100% humidity. Tip: some say you need to wear pants and long sleeves, but shorts and t-shirts are ok - as long as women have their shoulders covered.</p>

			<h2 id="phuket">Phuket</h2>
			<p>Is it really a trip to Thailand if you haven't been to Phuket? Our tight schedule gave us 3 nights (2 full days) to enjoy the fine white sand beaches with turquoise clear waters.</p>
			<p>After our two hour flight from Bangkok to Phuket, we took another two hour bus ride to our hotel - The Sea Galleri. The hotel was located on a hill side that commanded gorgeous views of the sea - welcoming us into the "relax" part of our trip.</p>
			<p>The breakfasts at the hotel were awesome, not because of the food (although it was good), but because it was by the pool side and also on the hotel rooftop - giving wonderful views you could enjoy while you and ate. Really awesome way to start the day, and of course we went for plenty of dips in the pool. If we wanted a change of scenery, we could go down to the pool by the reception too! Even more, Kata beach and Kata Noi Beach is a very short shuttle bus ride down the hill.</p>
			<p>We spent most of our first full day wondering Phuket Old Town - about half an hour tuk tuk ride from Kata Beach. Roads in near the town center like Thalang, Phang Nga, and Dibuk Roads are full of old and colourful portuguese-style buildings apparently owing to the tin mining industry that used to exist in the area. It was low 30-degrees C when we went, so walking around alone was pretty sapping. Our massage at Sansabai Massage 2 was great not just because of the awesome deep tissue massages we got, but also because of the relief of a cold shower to rinse off with. Torry's Ice Cream was also a welcome treat to help keep cool, although it is very expensive by Thai standards. In total, we spent around 4h in Phuket Old Town.</p>
			<p>Our second day was allocated to a snorkeling cruise to Phi Phi islands and a couple other nearby islands. We went with Seastar who were very professional and also pretty popular. We made 3 stops for snorkeling, and 2 more for on-land sight-seeing and lunch. The waters were so clear and beautiful, and the sea-life plenty &#128031;. At one of the snorkeling stops, we were so surprised to see all the fish and that they were pretty indifferent to people. If you stay a little still for a bit, they would swim around you like you were another rock on the seabed! Winn unfortunately got seasick, so she was having a pretty bad time as the day went on, and as we discovered a couple days later - she was also pretty sick too &#128567;</p>
			<p>It's such a shame we only had a few nights at Phuket - I would've loved to spend a few more days lounging by the beach or swimming more in the waters.</p>
