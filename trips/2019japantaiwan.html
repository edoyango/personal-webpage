			<h1>Feb 2019 Japan & Taiwan Cycle Trip &#127471;&#127477;&#127481;&#127484;</h1>
			<p>This was originally a Japan-only trip with a friend. She could no longer make it, so I made this an opportunity to tick off a bucket list item: cycling around the circumference of Taiwan. I've wanted to do this since I learnt of the No. 1 route that goes around Taiwan. To add to this, I thought it would be fun to attempt to cycle Tokyo to Osaka as a "warmup".</p>
            <ol>
                <p>My plan:</p>
                <li>arrive in Tokyo;</li>
                <li>spend a couple days sorting myself out;</li>
                <li>cycle from Yokahama to Osaka (~500km) in 3 days;</li>
                <li>spend a night in Osaka to reorganise my things;</li>
                <li>fly to Taipei;</li>
                <li>spend a couple days to sort myself out;</li>
                <li>complete the Taiwan Cycle Route No. 1 (~1000km) as fast as I can;</li>
                <li>use the remaining time to see the sights in Taipei; and finally</li>
                <li>fly back to Melbourne from Taipei.</li>
            </ol>

        <div class="normalwidth">
            <h2>Logistics and gear</h2>
			<h3>My bike</h3>
            <p>I arrived in Tokyo Narita Airport and went back to Melbourne from Taipei airport. I brought my own bike, a Giant Propel SL1 (2014), in a <a href="https://cyclingtips.com/2016/02/review-scicon-aerocomfort-2-0-tsa-bicycle-travel-case/">scicon areocomfort 2.0</a> bike travel bag, which I bought second hand. I liked this bag because it had enough space for me to avoid having to dismantle the bike, except the wheels. I also used this bag as pseudo-check-in baggage for normal stuff like clothes, shoes, etc. I think the airlines tell you not to do this, but nobody checked.</p>
            <p>Key advantages to bringing my own bike is that it was already fitted and I was already accustomed to riding the bike. On trips like these, you spend a long time pedalling on your bike, and small changes in the fit can lead to injuries releated to repetitive strain or constant loading, as I discovered in the Japan leg (more details later). Having to use a loan bike and riding 100+ kms per day can require a fair bit of tweaking. Another advantage is that you don't have to worry about pickup and dropoff logistics. In Taiwan, this is not super challenging, as you can pick up and drop off bikes at Giant bike stores throughout the country. On the otherhand, Japan doesn't have such a company that facilitates this, so you typically have to return the bike at the store you rented it from. This is fine if you cycle only within a city, but for a trip like mine, it was <em>very</em> problematic.</p>
            <p>The key disadvantage is the potential damage to the bike in transport, and the additional costs associated with transporting the bike. Full-service airlines typically accept sports gear at no extra cost, but budget airlines will not.</p>
			<h3>Transporting luggage</h3>
			<p>This trip was fully unsupported, so I carried everything I needed with me. This included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>towel and toiletries,</li>
                <li>my laptop (so I could do work things),</li>
                <li>my camera and lenses,</li>
                <li>cold weather clothes (I was cycling in late-winter weather),</li>
                <li>underwear and lounge cothes,</li>
                <li>spare cycling clothes, and</li>
                <li>normal shoes to walk around in.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I also had "normal" luggage with me when I arrived to Japan, which I only needed when I was at the start and end destination cities like normal walking around clothes. I planned to cycle to Osaka and then depart to Taipei from there. Therefore, I had to send my normal luggage to Osaka ahead of me. To do this, I used <a href="https://www.jrailpass.com/blog/transporting-luggage-forwarding">luggage transport services available throughout japan</a>. I could use this service to send my bike bag, as well as normal luggage to my booked hotel in Osaka. In Taiwan, I kept my luggage at the hotel I stayed at the start and end of my cycle trip (usually this is for free, if you've stayed or will be staying with them.</p>
			<h3>Things I brought on the ride</h3>
            <p>Maintanence gear I brought are a couple tubes, a couple tires (in case something <em>really</em> bad happened to my tires), and a hand-held pump.</p>
            <p>Cycling kit I had was a couple jerseys, a couple bibs (one long and one short), cycling shoes, two pairs of cycling socks, a cycling jacket, and winter gloves that maintained grip in the rain. I also had a pair of leg warmers which I sometimes used with the shorts.</p>
			<p>I mostly ate at fast food places because I knew they had English on the menu, which was less common in small city restaurants. Snacks I picked up from convenience stores. Sometimes I would get breakfast there too, since I typically left my accomodation before the host could prepare food.</p>
			<h3>Routhe and Navigation</h3>
            <p>For Tokyo to Osaka, to find my route, I used Google Maps as a basis and modified the route based on how rideable the road looked on Street View. I broke up my days to be roughly equal in distance. To follow the route and track my activity, I used my phone with Strava.</p>
			<p>For Taiwan Route No. 1, I relied more on the signage which was available on the cycle paths on the route. Every now and then I pulled out my phone so I didn't miss any turns or to estimate distances. The route is very well-marked, so you can, in principle, get by with no navigation aid. I started in Taipei and took a clock-wise direction around, which is often recommened because of the steep hills east of Taipei. The ascent up the hills is gentler when coming from the other direction.</p>
			<h3>Accomodation</h3>
			<p>I booked accomodation in Japan all in advance via AirBnB, to ensure that the hosts were ok with having my bike. For Taiwan, I hadn't had a plan set in stone, so I booked ad-hoc via either AirBnB or Booking.com. It worked out ok for me, with the exception of one night where it was difficult because it was a long weekend and a lot of locals were travelling too. Everywhere was accepting of bikes too.</p>
        </div>

		<div class="normalwidth">
			<h2>Tokyo to Osaka</h2>
			<p>I flew into Narita and bussed to Yokohama - a bit further out from central Tokyo. I stayed a couple nights to sort out the logistics of having to send the bulk of my luggage to Osaka. I also had some time to enjoy the food and hiking that Japan had to offer.</p>
            <h3>Day 1: Yokohama to Shizuoka</h3>
            <p>I started this day riding south-west to reach the coast-line of Japan at Oiso. From there, I followed the coast, but a bit in-land to avoid coastal headwinds. I left quite early, so the roads in Yokohama were quiet, but as rush-hour traffic picked up, it became a bit painful due to the absence of bike lanes, accompanied by narrow single-line in either direction roads. Cycling to work/school is quite common, and they either ride on the footpath, or hug the road edge as much as possible, while the cars overtake them. The former would be a hassle, having to navigate pedestrians; so I did the latter, which was nerve-wracking at times. From Chigasaki onwards, car traffic moved slow enough for me to keep up, so it became a little less scary.</p>
            <p>The biggest obstacle of the day was Mt Hakone, a popular tourist spot, known for its hotsprings. I took the main road up, which meant I had to climb ~800m over ~15km. I later learnt that it's more common to ride <em>around</em> Mt Hakone to avoid the elevation. The ride down was much easier, but felt very unsafe. The road I took down Mt Hakone, looked like the main road by which trucks were transporting goods through the mountain. It meant I had to contend with trucks on single-lane roads down the mountain.</p>
            <p>It was rewarding to reach the peak of Mt Hakone, but I was incredibly exhausted climbing up it, and I didn't pace myself very well, resulting in needing frequent breaks and behing very behind schedule. I arrove at my accomodation exhausted and had thought already about quitting and taking a train to Tokyo.</p>

			<h3>Day 2: Shizuoka to Toba</h2>
			<p>I woke up today with a pretty bad pain in my left knee. I didn't let that dissuade me, so I powered on. But honestly, it got worse throughout the day and had to take many breaks because of the pain. I limped when walking, and having my knee bent in certain angles were really painful. It was the least painful while cycling, but still pretty painful.</p>
			<p>Today's goal was to reach Miyashita Iragocho before the next-to-last ferry to Toba at 4:30pm. Toba is a hot spring town popular with locals. It was going to be a bit tight getting onto that ferry, but I wanted to make sure I arrived at the accomodation within the check-in window. Furthermore, I didn't stay at Iragocho because the first morning ferry was a lot later than I would prefer to be starting my trip. Plus, it takes an hour, so today's relief would end up being tomorrow's stress.</p>
			<p>When arriving in Shizuoka, I followed the coastline pretty closely. But, today I avoided the coast by crossing the Oigawa Bridge, and going through the town of Kakegawa. I returned to following the coast shortly before Shirasuka. In Shirasuka, I ran into a couple guys who were also doing a similar route to me. I learnt that instead of climbing Hakone, they took the extra day to go around Mt Hakone. One of the guys was also experiencing knee pain issues. They were also planning to take the ferry, but I had intended to catch an earlier ferry. We didn't ride together because they were a bit more relaxed with their schedule and didn't mind staying in Iragocho (where the ferry departs from) for a night and taking the morning Ferry. I added one of the guys on Facebook, and we parted ways.</p>
			<p>The ride to Iragocho was pretty chill - mostly flat with rolling hills in some parts. The most direct route was on the road along the southern coast. I made the ferry on time, and headed to Toba to my stay for the night. The guys I met before, managed to catch the last ferry at 8pm. I didn't get into my accomodation until late, because I didn't give the host an arrival time, and he had he wasn't checking his phone. By the time I got around to dinner, it was late, and I ate at Hamanami, the only restaurant open around me. Afterwards, I made a visit to Todaya, a hot spring resort nearish to me.</p>
			<p>The Strava activity was cut short by about 30km before reaching the ferry, because my phone accidentally ended the activity early.</p>

			<h3>Day 3: Toba and failing to get to Osaka</h2>
			<p>I woke up today with even more pain in my left knee than the previous. The hot spring didn't help at all! I struggled to get down the stairs in the morning. I still gave it a go - one more day, how bad could it be?</p>
			<p>Anyway, I rode about 30km before giving up &#129315;. The headwind was pretty strong, so I ended up with additional load on my injured knee. I needed to get a bikebag to store my bike to bring it on the train back to Osaka - compulsory for trains in Japan. I took the train from Matsugasaki Station to Osaka and finished the Japan leg with sushi train (Genrokuzushi Osaka) and Onsen (Yasaka Onsen), and getting ready to take my flight to Taiwan.</p>

			<h2>Taiwan Cycle Route No. 1</h2>
			<p>I didn't do anything on the first day after arriving in Taipei. My knee hurt when walking, so I confined myself to the bed. I only left the room for food, which was easy because Maccas was on the ground floor of the accomodation. But the next day, I put my bike together and repositioned my cleats, so my toes were pointing a couple degrees outward, rather than straight on. and did an easy 22km ride around the cycle paths which were almost all flat. I also made a visit to the Giant store nearby to grab a pair of light armwarmers, since it wasn't as cold in Taiwan to need a jacket most of the time. In terms of planned duration or daily distance, I was going to let my the pain in my knee at the start of the day govern how far I would go. As a minimum, I aimed to do the whole Cycle Route No. 1 in 10 days (a bit less than 100km per day). I planned to skip the "dangerous" section of road between Hualien and Yilan, which is <a href="https://www.bikeexpress.com.tw/2020/around-the-island-in-9-days-day-8-hualien-to-yilan/">often recommended</a>.</p>
			<h3>Day 1: Taipei to Zhunan</h3>
			<p>Today I was going to leave Taipei, make a brief crossing into the Taoyuan province, and finish in Zhunan - a city in Hsinchu province, a bit south of the province capital. I didn't book accomodation for the night before I started, because I wasn't sure how my knee would go. AirBnB had plenty of availability too. </p>
			<p>The first 20kms coming out of Taipei is flat, urban terrain; followed by a slow ascent up to 300m for a bit over 32km - just as you approach the border between Taoyuan and Hsinchu province. From there, it's descending or flat. Eventually Route No. 1 takes you to highway 79 which follows the coast. The western (as well as the eastern) coast has a southerly wind going most of the time, so I had a strong tailwind for the last 12km of my ride into Zhunan. Ample convenience stores and small restaurants available throughout the route, so no worries regarding food!</p>
			<p>My knee was still a bit sore by the end of the day, but it wasn't <em>worse</em>, which was good news for me. 100km was bearable, so if it stays the same, then I should have no problem making it to the end!</p>

			<h3>Day 2: Zhunan to Yuanlin</h3>
			<p>Today, the route had me follow the coast most of the way, before climbing slightly inward toward Taichung (total of ~108km). I was feeling pretty good, so I rode the extra 26km to Yuanlin. I booked my accomodation during the day, after deciding I felt pretty good to push a bit more. There wasn't <em>heaps</em> of accomodation in the area, so I ended up paying more than I would've liked.</p>
			<p>The day started with a bit of a drizzle, but cleared up past 9am-ish. My knee felt pretty bad at this point, but miraculously, by lunch time, the pain had almost complete disappeared! I could cycle and walk pretty normally and almost pain free! Things were finally looking up &#128522;.</p>
			<p>The route is pretty flat - with max ~90m of elevation gain for a given climb.</p>

		</div>

		<div class="normalwidth">
			<h3>Day 3: Yuanlin to Tainan</h3>
			<p>I planned to go all the way to Tainan, which took 130km all up, all away from the coast. The route had a net decent of 24m, so was pretty chill. The roads were in a less populated area, so stop lights were less frequent too.</p>
			<p>My knee continued to be pain free, so I felt pretty good. I was happy to have an easy day, but the scenery was a bit drab.</p>
			<p>I tried booking accomodation in the afternoon. I was really lucky to get a bunk space in a hostel - all the accomodation in Tainan and nearby areas was booked out because of the long weekend. According to the owner of the hostel, usually there's a lot of openings! Tainan is supposed to be the city of food in Taiwan, so usually a good idea to stop at on your ride!</p>

		<div class="normalwidth">
			<h3>Day 4: Tainan to Fangshan</h3>
			<p>Kaohsiung was today's mid-point, with the ultimate destination being the coastal town of Fangshan. This town is just before where I would cross the mountain range to get onto the east coast of Taiwan. Kaohsiung is a nice city to visit, so I would recommend staying for longer if possible.</p>
			<p>The route was flat again, with a net decent of 10m. Navigating the city roads of Tainan and Kaohsiung can be a bit tricky, so I had to rely on google maps a bit more than usual.</p>

		</div>

		<div class="normalwidth">
			<h3>Day 5: Fangshan to Taichung</h3>
			<p>Today I needed to cross the mountain range to get to the east coast. My final destination would be to head north to Taitung (total of 100km and net 0 elevation change). There isn't anything stopping you from going all the way to the top of Taiwan (Hengchun), so that is an option to explore if you've got time.</p>
			<p>The climb is over the tail end of the mountain range, so is quite small compared to the rest of Taiwan. The climb itself was about 450m over 25km, starting very gradual at about 1% gradient for 18km, and then increasing to ~4% average gradient for the remaining 7km. The descent to sea level is uninterupted and goes on for about 12km. At the bottom of the mountain is a 7-Eleven, which is the last one in awhile, so you may want to stock up on water and snacks at this point. The remaining ride to Taitung is mostly flat, with a few short & sharp climbs </p>
			<p>The east coast typically has a southerly wind, but I lucked out with a northerly tailwind.</p>
			<p>I stayed at 40Inn Backpackers in Taitung, which is the only accomodation I would give a strong recommendation for, just because of their nice vibe and friendly english-speaking staff. The Taitung night market is also pretty solid, compared to the other night markets I went to in Taiwan.</p>

		<div class="normalwidth">
			<h3>Day 6: Taitung to Hualien</h3>
			<p>Going to Hualien, I followed the coastal highway most of the way, which was rolling almost the whole 150km. Near the end, there is a short climb of 210m over ~9km to mentally prepare for. There is an alternative route that takes you further in land, but is much hillier and less scenic, but with fewer cars to contend with.</p>
			<p>The whole ride is very scenic, although you have to ride alongsid cars a lot of the time. I was lucky for the northerly wind to push me lightly along. There was a surprise downpour just before I reached Hualien, which waterlogged my laptop and killed its screen &#128546;.</p>

		</div>

		<div class="normalwidth">
			<h3>Day 7: Nanxing to Jiaoxi</h3>
			<p>This is the recommended rest day. From Hualien, the roads can be very narrow and many trucks and blind corners. Hence why many recommend to take the train from Hualien to Suaoxin Station. You can then keep your legs active by riding the short (30km) and flat (13m up) distance to Jiaoxi, a hot spring town.</p>

		</div>

		<div class="normalwidth">
			<h3>Day 8: Jiaoxi to Taipei</h3>
			<p>Last day! It was on the shorter side too, being "only" 94km. It initially followed the coast to the eastern most point of Taiwan, before heading back west and crossing the hills into Taipei. The hills are nothing dramatic in terms of gradient and elevation gain, so don't worry too much. You get to enjoy a very comfortable down hill ride into Taipei, but the roads are a bit narrow and there are a few blind corners, so make sure to take it slow if you're not a confident descender!</p>

			<h2>Reflections and future improvements - 3 years later</h2>
			<h3>Bike Fitting</h3>
			<p>The biggest challenge for this trip was probably from the knee injury I received after the first day cycling in Japan. I eventually learnt that it originated from a very minor adjustment in cleat position, as the pain reduced significantly after I fixed that up. I originally made this adjustment because I noticed that my left cleat alignment was slightly different from my right cleat, which was "straighter". So, I set the left cleat to be the same as the right cleat. Consequently, my key take away when undertaking these long-distance rides, is not to mess around with your positioning, without time to test, if it's already working for you. </p>
			<h3>Packing</h3>
			<p>I think a related takeaway would be to make sure I was somewhat comfortable with such distances before hand. I ultimately had the fitness to complete the ride, but I didn't really know how to pace myself, especially up long climbs like Mt Hakone. The longest climb I have in my local area is about half the elevation gain. Writing this now with hindsight, I feel a lot more comfortable with pacing, especially now since I have a powermeter and have used it a lot for training.</p>
			<h3>Equipment</h3>
			<p>I carried all my things in a backpack, which was <em>ok</em> I guess, but my back was really tired in the last couple days of the trip, and often my back would be the most tired part of my body after each day. Now I know about how bikepackers use handlebar, frame, and large saddle bags; I will leverage that more in the future. I would also want to make sure these bags are waterproof, so any electronics don't get wet in unforseen rain events.</p>
			<p>I was pretty lucky this trip by not sufferring from punctures, but in the thousands of km I've cycled in the past years, enver have I needed to change tires. I probably could've dropped those from my maintenence kit.</p>
			<p>For the Taiwan leg, I probably didn't need to bring my own bike. It was a bit of a hassle and more expensive. If I were to do the Taiwan bike ride again only, I would lean on the Giant bike rental program, but maybe bring my own saddle, pedals, and bike shoes.</p>
			<h3>Food</h3>
			<p>I think my food strategy was OK, which was to rely on the frequent and cheap convenience and fast food stores in both Japan and Taiwan. But I do need to remember that this is a luxury in most other countries, and will have to sort out and probably carry food when doing something similar elsewhere.</p>
			<h3>Navigation</h3>
			<p>My time navigating in Japan was pretty bad, the roads in cities are a maze, cycle paths are non-existent, and often roads will turn into cars only roads. Intersections are also everywhere, so you have to stop-start pretty frequently, which I suspect also made it harder to cope with the knee pain. So, if I were to do the Tokyo to Osaka trip again (which I very much want to, since I failed so spectacularly), I would do more research into bike-friendly routes.</p>
			<p>Using my phone for navigation also wasn't ideal because of its limited battery, so I would want to use something with greater battery life like a Garmin bike computer. I do have a Garmin watch, but it's annoying and sometimes dangerous to have to look at my wrist for navigation.</p>
			<p>Taiwan was actually pretty ok without good navigation tools, thanks to the Cycle Route No. 1 markings and signage. I would've still benefitted from having a bike computer though. I think next time I would like to give myself more time to see the sights, e.g., I would've liked to actually tour Toroko Gorge, which I skipped seeing.</p>
			<h3>Overall</h3>
			<p>The bike ride was really made challenging by the knee injury, which was partially caused and exacerbated by my lack of experience with these kinds of rides. I was disappointed in myself that I let myself get injured in Japan, but proud that I still managed to finish the Taiwan journey. I think I learnt a lot about how to manage these trips and my own limits. These days I'm a lot busier, but I hope I'll have the chance to properly complete the Tokyo to Osaka trip again, maybe even in 3 days; and maybe even do the Taiwan leg too, but perhaps even faster!</p>
