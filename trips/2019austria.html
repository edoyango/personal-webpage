			<h1>Sept 2019 Austria &#127462;&#127481;</h1>
			<p>I was in Austria for a workshop in Vienna for my Masters. Besides Vienna, I made stops to Insbruck, and Salzburg (where the Sound of Music was shot).</p>
            <h2 id="vienna">Wienn (AKA Vienna)</h2>
            <p>I started in Vienna, attending the workshop. I spent one whole day in Vienna before heading to Innsbruck, and about 1.5 days there again before heading back to Melbourne.</p>
            <p>I didn't invest a lot into looking for interesting things to do. I made visits to (non-exhaustive):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Schönbrunn Palace, for an orchestra performance inside;</li>
                <li>Sacher Hotel Cafe, for the Sachertorte;</li>
                <li>The natural history museum (way more beautiful than any museum I've seen before);</li>
                <li>The Cafe Museum;</li>
                <li>Spittelberg; and</li>
                <li>Kohlmarkt</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="innsbruck">Innsbruck</h2>
            <p>I took the train from Vienna to Innsbruck, which took about 5h. I stayed in Innsbruck only to do a multi-day hike, as it's a region in Austria known for its outdoor activities. I loosely followed the first half of the <a href="https://www.innsbruck.info/en/hiking/hiking/long-distance-walking-trails/the-karwendel-ridgeway.html">Karwendel Höhenweg trail</a>.</p>
            <p>I took the train from Innsbruck to Reith b.Seefeld Bahnhof train station, where I started the hike. The hike is pretty well-signed, so navigation is not really an issue. However, the hike requires traversing up and down steep rocky sections where the rocks are quite loose. Having appropriate hiking shoes is strongly recommended.</p>
            <p>I used the huts for accomodation, and didn't need to book in advance. The first hut, Nördlinger Hütte, was quite popular, so I would recommend booking that in advance if you're in a big group. The other huts I stayed at (in order) were Bettelwurf Hütte, and Pfeis Hütte. </p>
            <p>After the first day, I had to come down from Nördlinger Hütte because I didn't bring the right socks and my shoe was giving me blisters. I continued the track (kind of) and getting down to Seefeld Bahnhof, took the train back to Innsbruck, and took the cable car back and walked to Bettelwurf Hütte, where I stayed for the night. The next night I stayed at Pfeis Hütte and walked to Scharnitz Bahnhof to take the train back to Innsbruck.</p>
            <p>The hike is quite challenging and quite a lot of distance is covered, so I would recommend this only if you're pretty fit and have good balance and hand-eye coordination.</p>

			<p>Salzburg is famous for being where The Sound of Music was filmed. I spent a couple nights here, where I rented a bike and rode around Salzburg (would highly recommend).</p>
