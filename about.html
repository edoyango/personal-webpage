			<p>I'm currently located in Melbourne moving between my partner's place and mine. I work in the Melbourne CBD at WEHI as a Research Computing Engineer where I support biological science (e.g. bioinformatics) researchers in their use of HPC for their research.</p>
			<p>In my free time, I like to run and hike with my partner, punctuated with the occasional bike ride. I also try to deal with my imposter syndrome by working on projects to build my tech skills (mostly in a scientific context).</p>
			<p>I would say I'm an early career specialist in scientific parallel programming frameworks like MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA/HIP; and the using and administering HPC systems.</p>

				<strong>My Life Story: The "boring" work stuff</strong><br>
				If you want to see what my career looks like
			</summary>
			After High School, I studied Civil Engineering and Finance double bachelors at Monash University, Clayton; graduating with first-class honours. I generally enjoyed the math/statistics/computation aspect of the degree, so following graduation, I went on to get a summer research scholarship looking at writing code to simulate lava flows, which developed further into a Masters project (funded by Australian Gov's RTP). This is where I learnt a lot about programming (in Fortran), and distributed parallel programming and HPC.
			<br><br>
			My first full-time job was at Golder Associates (acquired by WSP) where I was at for about a year. I worked as a site engineer on level crossings in Melbourne (watched a lot <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=piling&sxsrf=ALiCzsb9zA-iLo88-9zryXgZTQm3x8euBA:1669471991734&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjeiZ7og8z7AhVdRmwGHaAlAmoQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=988&bih=1286&dpr=1">pile foundations being installed</a>) Here I was <em>finally</em> convinced that I didn't want to be a Civil Engineer and so my next job was a tech job with Monash University as a junior on the HPC Team, which oversaw the HPC infrastructure at Monash Uni.
			<br><br>
			I learnt a lot at Monash, not least because the only tech knowledge I had up until then was limited to my niche area of research. What I learnt encompassed:
			<ul>
				<li>Basic Linux system administration</li>
				<li>Cluster setup with Ansible</li>
				<li>Helpdesk etiquette</li>
				<li>Basics around working with web pages</li>
				<li>A high-level view of how Lustre file-systems work</li>
				<li>Agile</li>
				<li>How Slurm works and how to configure it</li>
			</ul>
			And the list goes on...
			<br><br>
			Unfortunately I had joined at a time when dominos had starting falling and many key staff were leaving the team and the team was shrinking rapidly with no positive signs of improvement. And so I joined WEHI as a Research Computing Engineer.
			<br><br>
			My team at WEHI primarily acts as an in-between for WEHI researchers and WEHI IT staff who manage the research computing infrastructure (e.g. VMs, HPC). I was hired primarily for my HPC experience, so my work predominantly revolves around that:
			<ul>
				<li>Training researchers on how to use Slurm</li>
				<li>Benchmarking software</li>
				<li>Helping investigate issues with software running on HPC</li>
				<li>Documentation</li>
				<li>Helpdesk</li>
				<li>User onboarding onto WEHI's HPC</li>
				<li>Supporting researchers in container use</li>
			</ul>
			I've only been around for a few months at time of writing, so this list will surely grow. Areas of knowledge requiring development to adress needs in the team encompass: R, workflows on cloud computing platforms, and software packaging.
			<br><br>
			I'm aiming to develop my software engineering skills in "soft" ways like good design of software, and understanding of algorithms; and also learning "hard" skills like using debugging tools (valgrind, NVIDIA's and Intel's debugging suite), and broadening my familiarity with programming languages (currently working on R and C++).
			<br><br>
			I do love parallel programming, so I've been working pretty hard to build proficiency in CUDA programming (in C++ and Fortran).
			<br><br>
			I'm open to opportunities like:
			<ul>
				<li>Improving my core knowledge i.e. getting support to study degrees like applied math or computer science while working</li>
				<li>Postgraduate research degrees (i.e. PhD project in applying advanced computation techniques)</li>
				<li>Interested in opportunities in high-performance related areas of software-engineering e.g. quantitative finance/high frequency trading, scientific HPC (MPI and/or GPU)</li>
				<li>Overseas work</li>
			</ul>

				<strong>My Life Story: Extra personal details</strong>
				<br>
				A more candid and personal perspective on my life up until now
			</summary>
			Melbourne, Australia born and raised, the youngest of three children from first generation chinese immigrants - one of which was a housewife turned, but now retired, real estate investor. My other parent was a <a href="https://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaokai_Yang">pretty successful economics academic</a> (I'm always trying to showoff his Wiki page &#128514;).<br><br>
			My upbringing was pretty typical second-immigrant Chinese upbringing - pretty strict with plenty of extra curriculars. But I was lucky enought to spend school holidays tagging along on my Dad's work trips until his passing when I was 9, so I had seen a lot of the world by then (had been to every continent bar Africa and Antarctica by the age of 4!). But an atypical aspect of my upbringing is the absence of spoken Chinese in my household. So now my Chinese in dog sh... Apparently my older brother didn't fair too well in a bilingual environment, so my parents made the decision to speak English only. Oh well &#129335;<br><br>
			Up to the end of middle school my upbringing was still pretty strict (swimming, piano, chinese, and tuition), but around year 9-10, my mum caved into my teenage rebellion and freed me form the shackles of a stereotypical asian upbringing. Highschool was where I also discovered that I loved math and was pretty good at it - was in the "accelerated" classes every year and finished highschool with a couple first-year math units completed too.<br><br>
			And then came my biggest mistake...<br><br>
			Choosing Civil Engineering and Commerce double bachelors instead of a math heavier degree(s)! Tsk tsk, looking back, this has been my biggest regret (although I have plenty of life left to make more mistakes!).<br><br>
			Anyway, I finished my double bachelors with first-class honours. But importantly, in my final year I was lucky enough to get accepted into a final year academic project with a very computational/math heavy Civil Engineering <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MBYnTHEAAAAJ&hl=en">lecturer</a>.
			<br><br>
			This project introduced me to writing Fortran code for simulating granular materials, using the commandline, and simulation concepts like time-integration algorithms. This developed into a summer research scholarship and eventually a masters project. There I got to spend all my time programming and running simulations on Australia's biggest "public" clusters - and where I found my love for scientific computing and HPC.
			<br><br>
			This new-found interest ultimately went on to inform my career choices in the past couple years, including the decision to leave Golder.
			<br><br>
			These days are mostly concerned with "adulting" acitivities - time spent building tech skills to make up for lack of tech degree, family gatherings and activities, managing finances, chores, and so on. Concerns that are in the back of my mind currently:
			<ul>
				<li>How can I further my career in tech and scientific computing?
				<ul>
					<li>Should I study an undergraduate degree to get that foundation I feel I'm missing?</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>If we should purchase a property, and what kind?</li>
				<li>Where and when should I learn cantonese, so I can more meaningfully interact with my partner's family?</li>
			</ul>
