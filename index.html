		<h1>Welcome to Ed's Space</h1>
		<p>A space for recording my adventures, work, and a play space for all things web.</p>
		<p>This page is a fun (and maybe useful) excuse to learn about coding web pages and hosting web apps.</p>

			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I'm Australian grown, and currently located in Melbourne, Victoria - where I've spent my entire life (besides travelling for holidays).</p>
			<p>I abandoned my Civil Engineering and Finance degree to pursue a career working with tech! I started with tech in a research context, so my knowledge and experience have mostly been in a scientific context:
				<ul>
					<li>Fortran, Matlab, Python, C++ (in order of profficiency)</li>
					<li>Parallel programming (MPI, OpenMP, CUDA)</li>
					<li>HPC use and admin</li>
					<li>Singularity & Docker</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>My current day job is a Research Computing Engineer at WEHI helping biological-science researchers with HPC, cloud computing, basic UNIX training, and accelerating research.</p>
			<p>Currently working to improve on (in no order):
				<ul>
					<li>CUDA</li>
					<li>Working understanding of bioinformatics/biology</li>
					<li>Cloud computing (emphasising Openstack)</li>
					<li>Bioinformatics tools like R, workflow managers (nextflow, snakemake)</li>
					<li>Web apps</li>
				</ul>
